## Speed Breeding for the development of Climate resilient crop cultivars


Modern plant breeding, after having had found its roots with the rediscovery of Mendel's work around 1900s, has been progressing in rapidly. To this end, quite a spectrum of individuals have contributed to ideas and innovations. Some of the notable of these include molecular genetic tools developed by Watson and Crick (1953) and DNA sequencing technologies - pioneered by Sanger and colleagues -  that gained traction during later half of 20th century. These molecular genetic techniques coupled with micropropagation have contributed substantially to increased genetic gain per breeding cycle in plant breeding endeavors. Genetic gains per cycle have almost doubled for some crop, thanks to recent development of high resolution genetic markers and use of marker assisted breeding in optimized populations as well as natural population of crops. Absolute gains in variety development time in terms of exact period it takes for improvement of poor cultivar to an improved one are impeded by the the fundamental facts of life - crop physiology.

Growth physiology, although being a vital has been a major handicap in rapid breeding progress. Crops require certain period of exposure to environmental factors to progress in the growth phase, for example, several cultivars wheat require a period persistent cold temperature to transition from vegetative to floral growth despite the floral primordia being already present from early growth stages. This situation is no more a compulsion now.

Speed breeding technique is a combination of improved methods that hasten breeding steps. First inspired by NASA's work with the research adapted at the University of Queensland, the latter also coined the term. Although traditionally botanists showed the plants grow quicker under artificial lights, later on organized study on use of continuous light on plant growth were evaluatated and verified to result in faster flowering (in almost 100 species). In 1990s, LEDs were evaluated at the university of Wisconsin and continuous improvement in LED techology has substantially reduced the cost of indoor plant propagation systems that increase crop productivity.

Traditional phenotyping are being largely supplemented by high-throughput phenotyping platforms.
The first speed bred variety of wheat "DS Faraday" was developed and released in australia . The work was a combined approach of accelerating the introgression of genes for grain dormancy that acts through inhibition of germination at crop maturity. This crop had improved tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting as a result. Monochromatic red or blue light sources (as chlorophyll predominantly absorbs light in the red and blue portions of the spectrum) can be used to cultivate crops, such plants develop atypically in short span of time.

Spreed breeding technique has successfully been employed in a range of modern cultivated crops, in addition to some of the conservation programs exploiting the same technique in rescuing species in Wild (recently american chestnut species Castanopsis have been been intogressed fungal blight tolerance and speed bred for high sped progpagion)..  Specialized protocols are available for speed breeding of wheat and other species that  require vernalization or short days. The combination of seed chipping and barcoding for tracking individual plants can also faciliate high-throughput marker-assisted selection.

Speed-breding is such an adaptive technquie that it is possible also for the reseachers with small, low-cost breeding programs. Speed breeding could accelerate the discovery and use small scale germplam collection mainly by facilitating quicer characterization and screening.

However with these developments, concerns are that recent varietal development and institutional registration programs haven't been able to keep pace with actual generation of germplasm lines/genotypes.
