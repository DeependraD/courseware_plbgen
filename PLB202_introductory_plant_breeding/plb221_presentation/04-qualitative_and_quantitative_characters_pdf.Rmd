# Qualitative and quantitative characters

## 

- The character may be simply inherited or complex inherited with effect of many genes at different loci, each contributing a small effect to phenotypic expression of the character
  1. Qualitative characters
  2. Quantitative characters
  
- Study of inheritance of most characters/phenotypes can be classified into:
  1. Easily distinguished into discrete classes 
    - barley plants may be 
      - black or white hulled 
      - two or six rowed 
      - rough or smooth awned 
      - rust resistanct or rust susceptible
      
  2. Cannot be easily classified into discrete classes
    - for grain yield $kg~ha^{-1}$
      - thousand grain weight (gram), 
      - plant height (cm) variation may be differing by small units

\begin{itemize}
\footnotesize
\item Nature of traits: Qualitative genetics is concerned with traits that have Mendelian inheritance and can be described according to kind and, as previously discussed, can be unambiguously categorized. Quantitative genetic traits are described in terms of the degree of expression of the trait, rather than the kind.
\item Scale of variability: Qualitative genetic traits provide discrete (discontinuous) phenotypic variation, whereas quantitative genetic traits produce phenotypic variation that spans the full spectrum (continuous).
\item Number of genes: In qualitative genetics, the effects of single genes are readily detectable, while in quantitative genetics single gene effects are not discernible. Rather, traits are under polygenic control (genes with small indistinguishable effects).
\item Mating pattern: Qualitative genetics is concerned with individual matings and their progenies. Quantitative genetics is concerned with a population of individuals that may comprise of a diversity of mating kinds.
\item Statistical analysis: Qualitative genetic analysis is quite straight forward; it is based on counts and ratios. On the other hand, quantitative analysis provides estimates of population parameters (attributes of the population from which the sample was obtained).

## Quantitative inheritance

- Most of the important variation displayed by nearly all plant traits affecting growth, development and reproduction, is quantitative.
- Also called: *Continuous*, *Polygenic variation*, *Multiple gene controlled traits*
- Demonstrate same basic Mendelian properties for a gene, and also the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
- Quantitative characters are governed by several genes; each gene has a small effect, which is usually cumulative.
- The environments considerably affect these characters.
- Quantitative characters often show continuous variation with normal distribution

## Qualitative inheritance

- Mendel purposed the law of inheritance based on his studies with qualitative characters. 
- In the studies of qualitative inheritance, we study phenomena such as:
  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item Dominance, 
  \item Segregation  and independent assortment, 
  \item Gene action and interactions (Epistatis, Masking gene action, Duplicate gene action, Complementary gene action, Additive gene action, Inhibiting gene action, Modifying gene action and Pleiotropy).
  \item Penetrance and expressivity
  \item Linkage
  \end{itemize}

```

## Penetrance 

\footnotesize

- The ability of a gene to express itself in the individuals carrying it in the appropriate genotype. 
- Generally, oligogenes express themselves in all individuals that carry them and their expression is fairly uniform.
- But some oligogenes fail to express themselves in some individuals carrying them and are said to have incomplete penetrance. 
- Gene expressing itself in every individuals that carries it is said to have complete penetrance.
- In the analysis of single-gene inheritance, there is a natural tendency to choose mutants that produce clear Mendelian ratios. In such cases, we can use the phenotype to distinguish mutant and wild-type genotypes with almost 100 percent certainty. In these cases, we say that the mutation is 100 percent penetrant into the phenotype. However, many mutations show incomplete penetrance: that is, not every individual with the genotype expresses the corresponding phenotype. Thus, penetrance is defined as the percentage of individuals with a given allele who exhibit the phenotype associated with that allele.
- Reasons for incomplete penetrance: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item The influence of the environment
  \item The influence of other interacting genes
  \item The subtlety of the mutant phenotype
  \end{itemize}

## Expressivity

\begin{columns}[T, onlytextwidth]
\column{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\small
\item The ability of a gene to express itself uniformly in all individuals that carry it in the appropriate genotype.
\item A gene that expresses itself uniformly in all individuals has uniform expressivity while those that are unable to do so have variable expressivity. 
\item Expressivity measures the degree to which a given allele is expressed at the phenotypic level; that is, expressivity measures the intensity of the phenotype. For example, "brown" animals (genotype b/b) from different stocks might show very different intensities of brown pigment from light to dark. As for penetrance, variable expressivity may be due to variation in the allelic constitution of the rest of the genome or to environmental factors.
\item Expressivity is indicated as variable or uniform.
\end{itemize}

\column{0.4\textwidth}

```{r expressivity, fig.cap="Assume that all the individuals shown have the same pigment allele (P) and possess the same potential to produce pigment. Effects from the rest of the genome and the environment may suppress or modify pigment production in any one individual. The color indicates the level of expression.", fig.align='center', out.width="90%"}
# pdftools::pdf_convert("./../../references_plb/An Introduction to Genetic Analysis-W. H. Freeman (2015).pdf", pages = 266, format = "png", filenames = "./images/penetrance_expressivity.png", dpi = 300)
knitr::include_graphics("./images/penetrance_expressivity.png")
```

\end{columns}

## Effect in selection

- Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity confuse the relation between genotype and phenotype. 
- Consequently such genes pose difficulty in selection of desired types.

# Threshold characters

- Some genes require specific environment, e.g a particular temperature, for expression. 
- Traits governed by such genes are known as threshold characters.
- For example, a mutant gene in barley produces albino seedlings at temperatures below $8^\circ C$. But when the seedling-carrying gene is grown at $19^\circ C$ or above, they develop into normal green seedlings.
- Incomplete penetrance of some genes may be due to a threshold requirement. 

# Multiple factor hypothesis

##

- Many genes with small cumulative effect for any one quantitative character account for bell-shaped normal curve appearance of common traits. The genetic factors responsible for this type of effects were termed as multiple factors.
- Now multiple factor has been replaced by polygene or multiple genes (purposed by Mather). 
- In 1908, Nilsson-Ehle presented experiment evidence to support this hypothesis by studying seed color in wheat and oats (demonstrated an actual segregation and assortment of genes with quantitative effect).
- Nilsson-Ehle crossed two varieties of wheat, one with deep red grain of genotype $R_1R_1R_2R_2$, and the other white grain of genotype $r_1r_1r_2r_2$.
- The distribution of resulting individuals from cross was explained on the basis of two pairs of genes segregating independently, which each dominant allele adding to the intensity of the red color.
- Two or more non allelic genes that affect in similar way of development of a quantitative character are called multiple genes or polygenes.

## Multiple factor hypothesis (Example)

- According to Nilsson-ehle, there were three individual gene pairs involved in determination of grain color in wheat, i.e., Aa, Bb, Cc, with genes for red (ABC) dominant over genes for white (abc). Each of these three gene pairs segregated in predictable mendelian fashion, so that the products of heterozygotes for any one pair, i.e. Aa x Ax, produced offspring in the ratio 3 red (A_):1 white (aa). When two gene-pair differences were segregating at the same time in Nilsson-Ehle's experiments, i.e., AaBb x AaBb, the results also followed mendelian principles, producing a ratio 15 red (A_B_, A_bb, aaB_): 1 white (aabb). Similarly a cross between heterozygotes for three gene paris produced a close fit to the predicted ratio 63 red: 1 white \footnote[frame]{Refer to Chapter 14: Quantitative inheritance, Genetics, Monroe. M. Strickberger, Page 245}.

# Transgressive segregation

##

- Appearance of features that are unlike either parent.
- Quantitative character of progeny may fall outside the range of parents is called transgressive segregation. 
- Transgressive segregation is used extensively by breeders to obtain segregates following a cross that are superior to the parental strains for traits inherited in a quantitative manner.

## Numerical problem

The leaves of pineapples can be classified into three types: spiny (S), spiny tip (ST), and piping (nonspiny; P). In crosses between pure strains followed by intercrosses of the F1, the following results appeared:

```{r pinapple-genetics, fig.align='center', out.width="40%"}
# pdftools::pdf_convert("./../../references_plb/An Introduction to Genetic Analysis-W. H. Freeman (2015).pdf", pages = 270, format = "png", filenames = "./images/pineapple_genetics.png", dpi = 300)
knitr::include_graphics("./images/pineapple_genetics.png")
```


a. Assign gene symbols. Explain these results in regard to the genotypes produced and their ratios.
b. Using the model from part a, give the phenotypic ratios that you would expect if you crossed (1) the F1 progeny from piping ? spiny with the spiny parental stock and (2) the F1 progeny of piping ? spiny with the F1 progeny of spiny ? spiny tip.

## Solution 1

\footnotesize

First, let's look at the F2 ratios. We have clear 3 : 1 ratios in crosses 1 and 2, indicating single-gene segregations. Cross 3, however, shows a ratio that is almost certainly a 12 : 3 : 1 ratio. How do we know this ratio? Well, there are simply not that many complex ratios in genetics, and trial and error brings us to the 12 : 3 : 1 quite quickly. In the 128 progeny total, the numbers of 96 : 24 : 8 are expected, but the actual numbers fit these expectations remarkably well.

One of the principles of this chapter is that modified Mendelian ratios reveal gene interactions. Cross 3 gives F2 numbers appropriate for a modified dihybrid Mendelian ratio, and so it looks as if we are dealing with a two-gene interaction. It seems the most promising place to start; we can return to crosses 1 and 2 and try to fit them in later.

Any dihybrid ratio is based on the phenotypic proportions 9 : 3 : 3 : 1. Our observed modification groups them as follows:

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
9A/\_;B/\_ &~& 9~piping \\
3A/\_;b/b &~& 3~piping \\
3a/a;B/\_ &~& 3~spiny~tip \\
1a/a;b/b &~& 1~spiny
\end{aligned}
$$

##

So, without worrying about the name of the type of gene interaction (we are not asked to supply this anyway), we can already define our three pineapple-leaf phenotypes in relation to the proposed allelic pairs A/a and B/b:

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
piping &=& A/\_ (B/b~irrelevant) \\
spiny tip &=& a/a; B/\_ \\
spiny &=& a/a; b/b
\end{aligned}
$$

What about the parents of cross 3 ? The spiny parent must be a/a ; b/b, and, because the B gene is needed to produce F2 spiny-tip leaves, the piping parent must be A/A ; B/B. (Note that we are told that all parents are pure, or homozygous.) The F1 must therefore be A/a ; B/b. Without further thought, we can write out cross 1 as follows:

##

\footnotesize

```{r cross1-ab, fig.align='center', out.width="34%"}
# pdftools::pdf_convert("./../../references_plb/An Introduction to Genetic Analysis-W. H. Freeman (2015).pdf", pages = 270, format = "png", filenames = "./images/cross_ab.png", dpi = 300)
knitr::include_graphics("./images/cross2_ab.png")
```

```{r cross2-ab, fig.align='center', out.width="34%"}
# pdftools::pdf_convert("./../../references_plb/An Introduction to Genetic Analysis-W. H. Freeman (2015).pdf", pages = 270, format = "png", filenames = "./images/cross_ab.png", dpi = 300)
knitr::include_graphics("./images/cross2_ab.png")
```

We know that the F2 of cross 2 shows single-gene segregation, and it seems certain now that the A/a allelic pair has a role. But the B allele is needed to produce the spiny-tip phenotype, and so all plants must be homozygous B/B:

```{r cross-multiple, fig.align='center', out.width="34%"}
# pdftools::pdf_convert("./../../references_plb/An Introduction to Genetic Analysis-W. H. Freeman (2015).pdf", pages = 271, format = "png", filenames = "./images/cross_multiple.png", dpi = 300)
knitr::include_graphics("./images/cross_multiple.png")
```

Notice that the two single-gene segregations in crosses 1 and 2 do not show that the genes are not interacting. What is shown is that the two-gene interaction is not revealed by these crosses-only by cross 3, in which the F1 is heterozygous for both genes.

##

b. Now it is simply a matter of using Mendel's laws to predict cross outcomes:

```{r trait-genetics, fig.align='center', out.width="40%"}
# pdftools::pdf_convert("./../../references_plb/An Introduction to Genetic Analysis-W. H. Freeman (2015).pdf", pages = 271, format = "png", filenames = "./images/trait_genetics.png", dpi = 300)

# Continuous variation

## Number of genes contributing to a quantitative character

A formula has been purposed for estimating the number of genes n involved in the inheritance of a quantitative character.

$$n = \frac{(\bar{P_1} -\bar{P_2})^2}{8[\sigma_{F_2}^2-\sigma_{F_1}^2]}$$

Where, $\bar{P_1}$ and $\bar{P_2}$ are trait means of inbred parents $P_1$ and $P_2$, respectively. $\sigma_{F_2}^2$ and $\sigma_{F_1}^2$ are standard deviation of $F_2$ and $F_1$, respectively.

## Components of variation of a quantitative character

\footnotesize

- Quantitative characters are more affected by environments.
- Phenotypic performance of genotypes evaluated in varied environmental conditions (MET) may be described according to a mathematical model to facilitate statistical analysis and interpretation.
- Yield (and quantitative characters alike) data show Genotype by Environment (G x E) interaction -- genotypes respond differently to different environments\footnote[frame]{For a detailed discussion of G x E and interpretation, refer to lecture slide on G x E from Molecular and Population Genetics course}.
- A traditional approach to the analysis of G x E is a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model where genotype, environment, and their interaction are treated as fixed effects with the model:

$$
y_{ijk} = \mu + g_{i} + e_{j} + ge_{ij} + \epsilon_{ijk}
$$

where, $y_{ijk}$ is the yield of the $k^{\text{th}}$ replicate of the $i^{\text{th}}$ genotype in the $j^{\text{th}}$ environment, $\mu$ is the overall mean (mean of all the possible genotypes grown under all possible environments), $g_{i}$ =  is the fixed effect of the $i^{\text{th}}$ genotype, $e_{j}$ is the fixed effect of the $j^{\text{th}}$ environment, $ge_{ij}$ is the interaction between $i^{\text{th}}$ genotype and the $j^{\text{th}}$ environment, and $\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the experimental error associated with the $ijk^{\text{th}}$ observation.

## Paritioning of variance components

  ~"Source of variation", ~"Degrees of freedom", ~"Mean squares", ~"Expected mean squares",

  "Genotype", "g-1", "$MS_G$", "$\\sigma^2_e + r \\sigma^2_{GE} + re \\sigma^2_{G}$",

  kableExtra::column_spec(column = 1:4, width = c("12em", "5em", "7em", "12em"))

```

Total phenotypic variance ($Var(Y_{ijk}) = \hat{\sigma}^2_{P} = \hat{\sigma}^2_{e} + \hat{\sigma}^2_{GE} + \hat{\sigma}^2_{G}$)

Phenotypic variance of genotypic means ($Var(\bar{Y}_{ijk}) = \hat{\sigma}^2_{\bar{P}} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_{e}}{re} + \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_{GE}}{e} + \hat{\sigma}^2_{G}$ = $\frac{MS_G}{re}$)

Genotypic variance = $\hat{\sigma}^2_{G} = \frac{MS_G - MS_{GE}}{re}$

# Heritability

## Meaning

\small

- To make economically meaningful progress in an organized programme of selective breeding, two conditions must be met;
  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item There must be some observable phenotypic variation within the crop. This would normally be expected, even if it were due entirely to the effects of a variable environment.
  \item At least some of this phenotypic variation must have a genetic basis.
  \end{itemize}
- This leads to the concept of heritability ($h^2$), which is the proportion of phenotypic variance that is genetic in origin.
- The values of $h^2$ can range from 0 to 1. If $h^2$ is close to zero, there will be little scope for advancement and there would be little point in trying to improve this character in a plant breeding program. 
- There are three main ways of estimating heritability:
  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item Carrying out particular genetic crosses and observing the performance of their progeny so that the resulting data can be partitioned into genetic and environmental components.
  \item Based on the direct measurement of the degree of resemblance between offspring and one, or both, of their parents. This is achieved by regression of the former onto the latter in the absence of selection.
  \item Measuring the response of a population to given levels of selection.
  \end{itemize}

##

### Broad sense heritability

\footnotesize

- The total genetic varinace divided by the total phenotypic variance is Broad-sense heritability ($h_b^2$). 
- This estimation uses the total genetic variance in a additive-dominance model, while the total phenotypic variance is obtained by adding environmental variance to this genetic variance.

$$
\small
h_b^2 = \frac{V_A + V_D}{V_A + V_D + V_E}
$$

- Dominant genetic variance will be dependent upon the degree of heterozygosity in the population and will differ between fillial generations.

### Narrow sense heritability

\footnotesize

- A more useful form of heritability for plant breeders, therefore, is *narrow-sense heritability* ($h_n^2$), which is:

$$
\small
h_n^2 = \frac{V_A}{V_A+V_D+V_E}
$$

- In estimation of $h^2_n$ genetic relationships among relatives (lineal (parent-offspring) or collateral (full-or half-sibs)) are used.

## Calculation

\small

- Variance based approaches (Useful for both broad and narrow sense heritability estimation) - ratio of variance estimates\footnote[frame]{Refer to previous section on partitioning of variance.}
  - Variance based approach still has two basis for obtaining heritability estimates -- individual experimental unit basis (Equation (i)) and genotypic-mean basis (Equation (ii)).

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
h_{bs}^2 &= \frac{\sigma^2_{G}}{\sigma^2_{P}} \\
h_{ns}^2 &= \frac{\sigma^2_{A}}{\sigma^2_{P}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\small
h^2_{bi} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_G}{\hat{\sigma}^2_G + \hat{\sigma}^2_{GE} + \hat{\sigma}^2_e}
\tag{i}
$$

$$
\small
h^2_{bm} = \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_G}{\hat{\sigma}^2_G + \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_{GE}}{e} + \frac{\hat{\sigma}^2_e}{re}}
\tag{ii}
$$

##

- Realized heritability
  - Heritability estimated using the amount of genetic gain that is realized by selection within a population (Falconer and Mackay, 1996).

$$
\small
h^2 = \frac{R}{S}
$$
  
- Six generation mean analysis method
  - Phenotypic mean values of each (P1, P2, F1, BCP1, BCP2, and F2) generation is required.

## 

- Parent offspring regression
  - This method is based on how much does the resemblance parents and offspring exist.
  - If there is perfect resemblance between parents and offspring, then, $b = 1$ and there is perfect heritable genetic effect.
  - On contrary if there is no resemblance between parents and offspring $b = 0$, and there is no heritable effect but variation is only due to environment.
  - Therefore, narrow sense heritability ( $b = h_{ns}^2 = \frac{VA}{VP}$ )
  - If only one parent is known (animal experiments or polycrosses):

$$
\small
\begin{aligned}
b &= \frac{1}{2}.\frac{Va}{VP}\\
h_{ns}^2 &= 2b
\end{aligned}
$$

where, $b$ = slope of parent offspring regression line

4. Suppose 2 inbred lines A and B are crossed to produce hybrid. The genotype of A is AAbbccDDEEFF and the genotype of B is aaBBCCddeeFF. A, B, C, D, E and F are the dominant genes. If dominant homozygote contributes 2 $ton~ha^{-1}$, recessive homozygote contributes 1 $ton~ha^{-1}$ and heterozygote contributes 2.5 $ton~ha^{-1}$, Find the grain yields of Parent A, Parent B and $F_1$ hybrid on the basis of dominance and over-dominance hypothesis.
