\section{The nature of cross pollinated
crops}\label{the-nature-of-cross-pollinated-crops}}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Plant species where normal mode of seed set is through a high degree
  of cross-pollination have characteristic reproductive features and
  population structure.
\item
  Each plant receives a blend of pollen from a large number of
  individuals each having different genotypes.
\item
  Allogamous species (producing seed through cross pollination) or out
  breeders have characters which promote cross pollination which include
  dichogamy, monoecy, dioecy, heterostyly, heterogamy, self
  incompatibility and male sterility.
\item
  Such populations are characterized by a
  \alert{high degree of heterozygosity} with tremendous
  \alert{free and potential genetic variation}, which is maintained in a
  steady state by free gene flow among individuals within the
  populations.
\item
  Breeding cross-pollinated species tends to focus on
  \alert{population improvement} rather than the improvement of
  individual plants.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Some important features of out breeders are:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    They have random mating. In such population, each genotype has equal
    chance of mating with all other genotypes
  \item
    Individuals are heterozygous and have advantage of heterozygosity
  \item
    Individuals have deleterious recessive gene which are concealed by
    masking effect of dominant genes.
  \item
    Out breeders are intolerant to inbreeding. They exhibit high degree
    of inbreeding depression on selfing.
  \item
    Cross pollination permits new gene combinations from different
    sources.
  \item
    In these species, variability is distributed over entire population.
  \item
    They have wide adaptability and more flexibility to environmental
    changes due to heterozygosity and heterogeneity.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  In the development of hybrid varieties, the aim is to identify the
  most productive heterozygote from the population, which then is
  produced with the exclusion of other members of the population.

\section{Population improvement
methods}\label{population-improvement-methods}}

\begin{frame}{Classification}
\protect\hypertarget{classification}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In addition to methods such as mass selection that are applicable to
  both self-pollinated and cross-pollinated species, there are specific
  methods that are suited to population improvement.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  According to the unit of selection -- either individual plants or
  family of plants.
\item
  According to the populations undergoing selection as either
  intra-population or inter-population.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In \textbf{intra-population} improvement, the end product will be a
  population or synthetic cultivar, and it may end up elite pure lines
  for hybrid production. Or, it can also be used for developing mixed
  genotype cultivars (in self-pollinated crops). Commonly used methods
  are mass selection, ear-to-row selection and recurrent selection. This
  consists of both single plant (mass selection) and family based
  selection (recurrent selection).
\item
  \textbf{Inter-population} improvement deals with the selection on the
  basis of the performance of a cross between two populations. The final
  product will be a hybrid cultivar with heterosis.
\end{itemize}

\ecolumns
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mass selection}
\protect\hypertarget{mass-selection}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is the simplest, easiest and oldest method of selection where
  individual plants are selected based on phenotypic performance, and
  seeds are bulked.
\item
  It is effective in maize improvement at the initial stages but its
  efficacy is poor for improvement of yield.
\item
  The selection after pollination does not provide any control over the
  pollen parent as result of which effective selection is limited only
  to female parents.
\item
  The heritability estimates are reduced by half, since only female
  parents are used to harvest seed whereas the pollen source is not
  known after the cross pollination has taken place.
\item
  Also, since this selection is solely based on phenotype, heritability
  of the trait plays a pivotal role in its effectiveness -- mostly
  effective for additive genes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Expected genetic advance}

\Delta G = \left[ \frac{\frac{1}{2}i \sigma^2_A}{\sigma^2_p} \right] = \left[ \frac{\frac{1}{2}i \sigma^2_A}{\sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_D + \sigma^2_{AE} + \sigma^2_{DE} + \sigma^2_e + \sigma^2_{me}} \right]
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Where,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \(\sigma_p\) = Phenotypic standard deviation in the population
  \item
    \(\sigma^2_A\) = Additive variance
  \item
    \(\sigma^2_D\) = Dominance variance
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Other factors are interaction variances. \(\Delta G_m\) doubles with
both sexes. This large denominator makes mass selection inefficient for
low heritability traits.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Recurrent selection}
\protect\hypertarget{recurrent-selection}{}
\small

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the simplest form, recurrent selection consists of selecting
  desired individuals within a population prior to mating followed by
  the intermating of selected individuals. Consequently, both female and
  male gametes have undergone selection, and genetic progress should be
  at least 100\% faster than for mass selection.
\item
  Recurrent selection scheme are variations of modification of progeny
  selection or ear to row method.
\item
  Steps:

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item Visually selected individuals out of the base population undergo progeny testing
  \item The parents are crossed in all possible combinations and individual families are created for evaluation, 
  \item The families are evaluated and a new set of parents are selected, and 
  \item The selected parents are inter-mated to produce the population for the next cycle of selection.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The aforesaid cycle is repeated several times (3-5 times). The
  original cycle is labelled \(C_0\) and is called the base population.
  The subsequent cycles are named as \(C_1, C_2, C_3, ... C_n\)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types of recurrent selection}
\protect\hypertarget{types-of-recurrent-selection}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Simple recurrent selection: Similar to mass selection with 1-2 year
  per cycle. Does not involve a tester. Phenotypic scores are the basis
  for selection (aka., Phenotypic recurrent selection).
\item
  Recurrent selection for general combining ability (Half sib progeny
  test procedure): When additive gene effects are more important.
\item
  Recurrent selection for specific combining ability: When overdominance
  gene effects are more important.
\item
  Reciprocal recurrent selection: When both gene effects are important.
  Two heterozygous population are involved, each serving as a tester for
  the other.

  that a new population that is superior to the original population is
  achieved.
\item
  The source material may be random mating populations, synthetic
  cultivars and single-cross or double-cross plants.
\item
  The improved population may be released as a new cultivar or used as a
  breding material (parent) in other breeding programmes.
\item
  This selection ensures improvement of population without reduction in
  genetic variability.
\item
  It is advisable to include as many parent as possible in the initial
  crossing to increase genetic diversity.
\item
  The breeder can decide on the number of generations of inter-mating
  that is appropriate for a breeding programme.

\small

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Selection entails discriminating among genetic variation to identify
  and choose a number of individuals to establish the next generation.
\item
  This results in differential reproduction of genotypes, i.e.~those
  that are selected have chance to increase their gene frequencies.
\item
  Subsequently, the genotypic and phenotypic values of the targeted
  traits also improve.
\item
  By selecting and advancing superior individuals (with high genetic
  potential) from a mixed population, the breeder aims to change
  population mean of the trait in a positive way in the next generation.
\item
  \alert{Response to selection} is the difference between the mean
  phenotypic value of the offspring of the selected parents and the
  whole of the parental generation before selection. It is related to
  \emph{heritability} as shown in the following
  \alert{Breeder's equation}:

  \footnotesize
  \item $R$ is the response to selection
  \item $h^2$ is the heritability of trait ($h^2_{bs}$ or $h^2_{ns}$)
  \item $S$ is the selection differential

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Selection differenatial (S)}
\protect\hypertarget{selection-differenatial-s}{}
\begin{itemize}

\item
  \alert{Selection differential (S)} is the mean phenotypic value of the
  individuals selected as parents expressed as a deviation from the
  population mean (i.e., from the mean phenotypic value of all the
  individuals in the parental generation before selection).
\end{itemize}

\[
S = X_s - X_o = i \sigma
\]

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Genetic advance achieved through selection depends on three factors:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \footnotesize
  \item Total variation (phenotypic) in the population in which selection will be conducted.
  \item Heritability of the target trait.
  \item Selection pressure to be imposed by the plant breeder (i.e., the proportion of the population that is selected for the next generation).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  For desirable gain from selection

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item Phenotypic variance should be large and clearly distinguishable
  \item Heritability of the selected phenotype should be high
  \item Selection pressure should be optimal.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In principle, the prediction of response is valid for only one
  generation of selection.
\item
  To predict the response in subsequent generations, heritabilities must
  be determined in each generation. Heritabilities are expected to
  change from one generation to the next because, if there is a
  response, it must be accompanied by change in gene frequencies on
  which heritability depends.
\item
  Also, selection of parents tends to reduce phenotypic variance
  especially in early generations.
