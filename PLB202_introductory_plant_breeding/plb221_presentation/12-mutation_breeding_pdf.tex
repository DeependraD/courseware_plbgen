  Discovery of the mutagentic effects of X-rays on the fruit fly
  (Drosophila) by H. Muller in the 1920s.
\item
  In 1928, H. Stubbe demonstrated the use of mutagenesis in producing
  mutants in tomatoes, soybeans, and other crops.
\item
  In terms of origin, mutations may be spontaneous (natural) or induced
  (artificial, with the aid of agents).
\item
  Spontaneous mutations arise at the very low rate of about 10-5 or 10-6
  per generation for most loci in most organisms. This translates to 1
  in 100, 000 or 1 in 1, 000, 000 gametes that may carry a newly mutated
  allele at any locus. They are caused by mistakes in molecular
  processes associated with the replication of DNA, recombination, and
  nuclear division.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Mutations that convert the wild type (the common phenotype) to the
    mutant form (the rare phenotype) are called forward mutations, while
    those that change a mutant phenotype to wild phenotype are called
    reverse mutations.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Forward mutations are more common than reverse mutations.
\item
  Recessive mutations are the most common types of mutations; However,
  recessive alleles in a diploid are expressed only when they are in
  homozygous state.
\item
  Consequently, an organism may accumulate a genetic load (the sum of
  deleterious genes that are carried, mostly hidden, in the genome and
  may be transmitted to descendants)
\item
  Induced versus Spontaneous Mutation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Spontaneous mutations produce novel alleles for the evolutionary
    process. These are carried over in a series of evolutionary process.
  \item
    Mutagenesis can used to create new alleles that can be incorporated
    to existing cultivars under guidance of artificial selection.
  \item
    The frequency of spontaneous mutation is low.

    resulting in a condition called chimera (Chimera consists of two
    genetically distinct tissues).

\section{Mechanisms of mutation}\label{mechanisms-of-mutation}}

\begin{frame}{Gene mutation}
\protect\hypertarget{gene-mutation}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Gene mutations entails a change in the nucleotide constitution of the
  DNA sequence, adding or deleting nucleotides.
\item
  DNA consists of four bases: A-T, C-G.
\item
  Types of gene mutations:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Transition
  \item
    Transversion
  \item
    Tautomeric shift
  \item
    Effect of base analogue
  \item
    Single base deletion or addition
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-3}{}
\emph{Transitions} Mutation by transition entails the conversion of one
purine base to another purine (or a pyrimidine to another pyrimidine).
Consequently, one normal base pair is converted to another pair, that is
genetically incorrect.

\emph{Transversions} It involves the substitution of a purine by a
pyrimidine and vice versa. Chemical mutagen such as NO has been known to
cause deamination of adenine to hypoxanthin, cytosine or uracil and
guanine to xanthine.

\emph{Tautomeric shifts} It is known that each of the bases of DNA can
exist in rare states as a result of the redistribution of electrons and
protons in the molecules, events called tautomeric shifts.

\emph{Effect of base analogues} Certain analogues of the naturally
occurring bases in the DNA molecule have been shown to have mutagenic
effects. For example, the natural base thymine (T), a 5-methyluracil,
has a structural analog, 5-bromouracil (5-BU). The two bases are so
similar that 5-BU can substitute for T during replication, leading to
base pair transition.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Effect of gene mutation at the protein level}
\protect\hypertarget{effect-of-gene-mutation-at-the-protein-level}{}
\small

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Silent mutation: Because the genetic code is degenerate (one amino
  acid can be coded by more than one triplet), a change from ACG→CGG has
  no effect as both triplets code for arginine.
\item
  Neutral mutation: This kind of mutation involves an altered triplet
  code that codes for a different but chemically equivalent amino acid.
  For example, CAC may change to CGC, altering histidine to a chemically
  equivalent amino acid, arginine. The change causes a change in the
  primary structure of the protein (amino acid sequence) but the form of
  the resultant protein may be unchanged.
\item
  Missense mutation: Unlike neutral mutations, a missense mutation
  results when an altered triplet codes for a different amino acid. Not
  all missense mutations lead to appreciable protein changes. For
  example, an amino acid may be replaced by another of very similar
  chemical properties, thereby altering the structure without impacting
  its normal function (a neutral mutation). Also, the amino acid
  substitution could occur in a region of the protein which does not
  significantly affect the protein secondary structure or function. On
  the other hand, some missense mutations have devastating consequences.
  For example, in hemoglobin of humans, a change of GAG (Glu) to GTG
  (Val) results in serious consequences (sickle cell anemia).
\item
  Nonsense mutation: A nonsense mutation causes an existing amino acid
  to be changed to a stop codon (e.g., TAA, TAG), resulting in premature
  termination of protein synthesis.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Frame shift mutation}
\protect\hypertarget{frame-shift-mutation}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Insertion--deletion} mutations (indels) may cause significant
  changes in the amino acid composition of a protein, and hence in its
  function.
\item
  For example, GAG--CCG--CAA--CTT--C (corresponding to
  Glu--Pro--Glu--Leu) may be altered by deletion of G that shifts the
  reading frame to the right by one nucleotide to produce AGC--CGC--
  AAC--TTC (corresponding to Ser--Arg--Asi--Phe).
\item
  Frameshift mutations typically result in complete loss of normal
  protein structure and function.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-4}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Errors in cell division resulting from disorders in the spindle
  mechanism may result in improper distribution of chromosomes to
  daughter cells.
\item
  Such errors may cause some cell division products to inherit more or
  less of the normal chromosome number. These errors, called chromosomal
  mutations, are of two main kinds:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    euploidy (cells inherit additional complete set of the basic
    chromosome set -- n) and
  \item
    aneuploidy (certain chromosomes are missing from the basic set or
    added to the set in some cell division products).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Structural chromosomal changes (aberrations)}
\protect\hypertarget{structural-chromosomal-changes-aberrations}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Changes in chromosome structure begin with a physical break that may
  be caused by ionizing radiation (e.g., X-rays). After a break, several
  events may occur:
\item
  The ends of the segment may be disunited.
\item
  The break may be repaired to restore the chromosome to its original
  form (restitution).
\item
  Or, one or both ends of a break may join to the ends produced by a
  different break event (non-restitutional union). These events may
  result in one of four types of rearrangement -- deletions,
  duplications, inversions, or translocations. The resulting
  consequences are variable.
\end{itemize}

\section{Mutagenic agents}\label{mutagenic-agents}}

\begin{frame}{Physical mutagens}
\protect\hypertarget{physical-mutagens}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The principal physical mutagens are ionizing radiations.
\item
  X-rays were first to be used to induce mutations. Since then, various
  subatomic particles (neutrons, protons, beta particles, alpha
  particles)
\item
  Gamma radiation from radioactive cobalt (60Co) is widely used. It is
  very penetrating and dangerous.
\item
  The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of fast neutrons is higher
  than for gamma rays and X-rays.
\item
  The dosage of radiation is commonly measured in Roentgen (r or R)
  units.
\item
  The exposure may be chronic (continuous low dose administered for a
  long period) or acute (high dose over a short period).
\item
  The radiation energy is transferred directly or indirectly to the DNA
  in cells through physical and chemical processes (collision,
  excitation, and ionization), causing damage to the cellular components
  that can generate erroneous base replacements during reconstitution,
  changing the genetic code and causing mutations.
\item
  Ultraviolet rays exhibit less penetration power and are used only for
  the treatment of single cells or small cell clusters.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Physical mutagens: Case study}
\protect\hypertarget{physical-mutagens-case-study}{}
Ferreira et al.~(2009) evaluated the effect of various doses of gamma
radiation on explant buds from fig trees of different sizes. The
seedlings were established in vitro, were separated according to size
(2.5 to 4.5 cm, 5 to 7 cm, and 8 to 10 cm), and were irradiated with 10,
20, 30, 40, and 50 Gy. After the irradiation, the seedlings were
transplanted into explants containing a single bud, were separated
according to bud position (basal, median, or apical), and were grown in
woody plant medium (WPM). The following traits were evaluated after 90
days' incubation in the growth room: explant mortality, root formation,
shoot length, bud number, and seedling weight. Doses of up to 50 Gy did
not cause seedling death, and doses greater than 30 Gy prevented the
formation of roots; therefore, the 30-Gy dose was recommended for the
irradiation of fig tree seedlings measuring greater than 2.5 cm.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Chemical mutagens}
\protect\hypertarget{chemical-mutagens}{}
\small

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Generally milder in their effect on plant material.
\item
  Can be applied without complicated equipment or facilities. The ratio
  of mutational to undesirable modifications is generally higher for
  chemical mutagens than for physical mutagens.
\item
  Usually, the material is soaked in a solution of the mutagen to induce
  mutations.
\item
  Chemical mutagens are generally carcinogenic and must be used with
  great caution.
\item
  One of the most effective chemical mutagenic groups is that of
  alkylating agents (they react with the DNA by alkylating the phosphate
  groups as well as the purines and pyrimidines).
\item
  Another group is the base analogues (they are closely related to the
  DNA bases and can be wrongly incorporated during replication);
  examples are 5-bromouracil and maleic hydrazide.
\item
  sodium azide (NaN3), which inhibits the activity of cellular
  respiration enzymes;
\item
  antibiotics (streptomycin, mitomycin C, and actinomycin D), which
  cause chromosomal breaks;
\item
  Other chemical mutagens commonly used are ethyl methane sulfonate
  (EMS) and diethylsulfonate (DES).
\item
  The half-life (time taken for degradation of half the initial amount
  of alkylating agent) for EMS in water is about 93 hours at 20 8C but
  only 10 hours at 37 8C.

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-5}{}
\small

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Objective: A program established to select one specific trait is more
  focused and easier to conduct with a higher chance of success than a
  program designed to select more than one trait.
\item
  Efficient screening method: Mutation breeding programs examine large
  segregating populations to increase the chance of finding the
  typically rare desirable mutational events. An efficient method of
  screening should be developed for a mutation breeding program. Proper
  choice of mutation and method of treatment. Mutagens, as previously
  discussed, vary in various properties including source, ease of use,
  penetration of tissue, and safety. Some are suitable for soft tissues,
  whereas others are suited to hard tissue.
\item
  Dose and rate

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item The proper dose rate is determined by experimentation for each species and genotype. 
  \item Plant materials differ in sensitivity to mutagenic treatment. It is difficult to find the precise dose (intensity), but careful experimentation can identify an optimum dose rate. 
  \item Mutagenic treatments invariably kill some cells. Overdose kills too many cells and often produces crippled plants, whereas underdose tends to produce too few mutants. Not only are dose–response relationships rarely known, but they are influenced by the experimental conditions. 
  \item It is recommended that three dose levels be used in a project – the optimal rate, plus one dose above and below this rate.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-6}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Experimental conditions

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It is known that the oxygen level in the plant material affects the
    amount of damage caused by the mutagen, the higher the oxygen level,
    the greater the injury to the material tends to be.
  \item
    The change in the effect of a mutagen with oxygen supply is called
    the oxygen enhancement ratio.
  \item
    Similarly, higher the tissue moisture, the lower the tissue oxygen
    supply.
  \item
    pH of the environment in chemical mutagenesis is equally important.
    For example, EMS is most effective at pH 7.0, whereas sodium azide
    is most effective at pH 3.0.
  \item
    Sometimes, dry seeds need to be pre-soaked to prepare the cells to
    initiate metabolic activity.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Mutation breeding

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-7}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In-vitro cell cultures treated with mutagenic agents reduces the
  incidence of chimeras, facilitates the selection of mutants for
  dominant or recessive traits that appear with a low frequency, and
  enables the use of chemical mutagens because this in vitro method
  circumvents the difficulty associated with tissue penetration when the
  treatments are performed in vivo in plant tissues propagated
  vegetatively.
\item
  When the expansion of natural genetic variability is desired or when
  there are restrictions on the use of conventional genetic improvement
  methods

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    lack of flowering in garlic precludes the use of crosses between
    different cultivars, genetic variation could be created by in-vitro
    mutagenesis
  \end{itemize}
\item
  According to Ahloowalia et al.~(2004), the main strategy for the use
  of mutagenesis in genetic breeding is to gain one or two of the traits
  of greatest interest without excessively changing important agronomic
  traits, including yield.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Both ex-vitro and in-vitro methods can be employed
\item
  In-vitro methods are best in that they require less space and provide
  opportunity for obtaining maximum regenerants.
\item
  After applying mutagens to the explants, which can be in the form of a
  callus or cell suspension, mutant cells, such as buds and pollen
  grains, among others, must be selected, and these cells will multiply
  and generate plants.
\item
  Protocols are available for generating specific mutations, including
  resistance to disease, herbicides, and soil salinity, which
  incorporate the problem-causing agents into the culture medium,
  thereby facilitating the identification of resistant or tolerant
  cells.
