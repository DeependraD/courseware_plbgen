\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There are over a quarter of a million plant species of which
  approximately 5000 are cultivated. But, only a 100 can be considered
  as important crops.
\item
  Ancestors of most of the modern crops (Used either in food chain or in
  industrial chain solely) have different appearance and even forms than
  what is seen today.
\item
  Plant breeding has a commercial history of 2/3 century at least.
\item
  By 19th century's end, artificial crossing, bulk and pedigree methods
  and alternative progeny testing schems were already used

"Breeder's eye" viewpoint of Plant Breeding: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Plant breeding is an applied science and an art 
\item Early plant breeders depended primarily on intuition, skill, and judgement in their work.
\item Plant breeding was practiced first when people learned to look for superior plants to harvest for seed; thus selection became the earliest method of plant breeding. However few people may have had conscious efforts in so-doing.
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}  %%<--- here
Scientific viewpoint of Plant Breeding: 
\begin{itemize}
\item "Breeding" is about a more active process of crossing different strains of plant for particular results.
\item Plant evolution directed by man (N.I. Vavilov)
\item Process of generating and utilizing variability
\item "Selection" is about picking the best from each generation
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-4}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  As human knowledge about plants increased, people were able to select
  more intelligently.
\item
  With the discovery of sex in plants, hybridization was added to
  breeding techniques.
\item
  Although hybridization was practiced before the time of Mendel, its
  significance in inheritance was not clearly understood.
\item
  Mendel's experiments provided a basis for understanding the mechanism
  of heredity and how it may be manipulated in the development of
  improved varieties.
\item
  A more precise explanation of the heredity mechanism has become
  possible in recent years with advances in biochemical genetics.
\item
  Now, plant breeding is more about making precise crossess and accurate
  prediction

  composition, to make them more useful to humans.
\item
  Plant breeding is essentially an election made by man of the best

  In other words plant breeding is a `selection' made possible by the

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Broadly, two distinct stages in plant breeding could be characterized

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Domestication of the first crops to the birth of Mendelian genetics
  \item
    Acceptance of Medelian genetics to post-mendel era
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The work of Gregor Mendel and further advances in science that
  followed his discoveries established that plant traits are controlled
  by hereditary factors or genes that consist of DNA (deoxyribose
  nucleic acid, the hereditary material).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History (Pre-mendel era)}
\protect\hypertarget{history-pre-mendel-era}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Plant breeding started with sedentary agriculture and the
  domestication of the first agricultural plants, the cereals, which
  were chosen by early man.
\item
  A family of French seed growers, the Vilmorins, established in 1727
  the first company devoted to plant breeding and the production of new
  varieties.
\item
  The sexuality of plants was described by Caesalpinus in 1583 and in
  1696 Camerarius published an essay entitled `De sexo plantarum', but
  it was Kolreuter, a German botanist who was the first to exploit this
  knowledge in the production of the first artificial plant hybrids in
  Nicotiana.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History (Post-mendel era)}
\protect\hypertarget{history-post-mendel-era}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  After the rediscovery of the work of Mendel in 1900 it was some six
  years before Bateson, who coined the name `genetics' for the new
  science, realized that this new discipline could give a scientific
  basis and new openings to plant breeding methods.
\item
  Genetics has given to breeding a better knowledge of the processes
  involved in the mechanisms of variability and the necessary
  information for regulating and increasing such variability.

\item
  Historically, good seed from high-yielding plants were stored in woven
  baskets and bartered for metal tools or cloth.
\item
  Nowadays test tubes and computers have replaced the baskets, and huge
  research budgets have replaced the barter.
\item
  Luther Burbank is the last great prescientific plant breeder.
\item
  Burbank admired Darwin but not Mendel
\item
  Remarkably strong start in plant breeding was made by Soviet
  Communists in twentieth century. But dissapointingly, intrigue and
  ideology ensured that Mendelian genetics was discarded.

"Charles Darwin's writing in the nineteenth century first formulated the idea of evolution, the idea that plants and animals are in constant competition, which results in the fittest or the best adapted surviving and passing on their genes to the next generation, those less well-adapted dying or failing to reproduce and so not passing on their genetic code. Life, then, is a constant winnowing and sifting of genetic material."

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Botany: Plant breeders should be accomplished botanists in order to
  understand the taxonomy, anatomy, morphology, and reproduction of the
  plants with which they work.
\item
  Genetics and Cytogenetics: The plant breeder needs a thorough
  understanding of the mechanism of heredity in plants since modern
  plant-breeding methods are based on a knowledge of genetic principles
  and chromosome behavior. This knowledge is being extended to the
  molecular level with advances in biochemical genetics.
\item
  Plant Physiology: Variety adaptation is determined by the response of
  plants to their environment, which includes the effects of heat, cold,
  drought, and soil nutrient response. The plant breeder strives to make
  inherent modifications of physiological processes that will enable the
  plant to function more efficiently.
\item
  Plant Pathology: Plant disease reduces crop yields. Host resistance is
  an important means of combating many plant diseases. Evaluation of the
  response ofthe plant genotype to infection by the pathogen is an
  essential part of breeding for host plant resistance.
\item
  Entomology: Biological control of insect populations by breeding for
  insect resistance is an important way of reducing insect damage in
  crop plants.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Plant Biochemistry: Inherent improvements in the nutritive value of a
  crop variety are given attention by the plant breeder. Suitability for
  industrial utilization often determines the market demand for a
  particular variety of a crop. This includes such characteristics as
  the milling and baking qualities of a wheat variety, the cooking and
  eating qualities of a rice variety, or the fiber qualities of a cotton
  variety. Biochemical genetics is contributing toward a better
  understanding of the structure and function of the gene.
\item
  Statistics: The plant breeder compares the performance of many
  genetically different strains. Sound field plot techniques and
  suitable methods for statistical analyses of data are necessary to
  obtain reliable results and to interpret the results correctly. The
  application of statistical procedures has provided for a better
  understanding of the inheritance of quantitative characteristics and
  for predicting the possible genetic advance that may be obtained with
  particular systems of mating.
\item
  Agronomy: In addition to all of these, the breeder of field crops
  should be a sound agronomist. Plant breeders should know crops and
  their production. They should understand what the farmer wants and
  needs in the way of new varieties. Only then will they be able to
  evaluate critically the breeding materials available to them, plan an
  efficient breeding program, and direct their breeding efforts toward
  the agronomically important objectives.

\item
  Creation of variation

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item Genetic variation can be created by domestication, germplasm collection, plant introduction, hybridization, polyploidy, somaclonal variation and genetic engineering
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Selection

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item Identification and isolation of plants having desirable combinations of characters and growing their progeny is called selection. Selection is necessarily based on phenotype. Various breeding methods have been designed to increase efficacy of selection. Selection finally yields an improved lines or population.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Evaluation

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item Newly selected lines/population are tested for yield and other traits. Performance is compared with existing best varieties (checks). Evaluation is a step-wise process, ordinary conducted at several locations for three or more years.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Multiplication

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item This step concerns the large scale production of source/certified seed after release and notification of varieties. Seed production is usually done by seed production organizations, in concert with seed certification agencies.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Certification and cultivar release

  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
  \item Certified seed is ultimately sold to the farmers who use it for commercial crop production. This activity alone makes it possible to reap the economic benefits from above activities.

\item
  Yield increase

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Achieved either through directly targeting the yield \emph{per se}
    or its components. Theoretically, any characterstic that enables
    plant to perform better in given biotic/abiotic stress condition can
    increase yield.
  \item
    In US, yield of corn rose from about 2000 kg/ha in the 1940s to
    about 7000 kg/ha in the 1990s.
  \item
    In England, it took only 40 years for wheat yields to rise from 2
    metric tons/ ha to 6 metric tons/ha.
  \item
    Between 1961 and 2000, FAO shows:
  \item
    Wheat yield increased by 681\% in China, 301\% in India, 299\% in
    Europe, 235\% in Africa, 209\% in South America, and 175\% in the
    USA.
  \item
    Although, a half proportion of the entire gain in yield levels could
    be attributed to genetic improvement per se, others being due to
    agronomic practices.

  \item
    The shelf life of fruits (e.g., tomato) has been extended through
    the use of genetic engineering techniques to reduce the expression
    of compounds associated with fruit deterioration.
  \item
    For example, cereals tend to be low in lysine and threonine, while
    legumes tend to be low in cysteine and methionine (both sulfur
    containing amino acids). Now biofortified series of cereal crops
    that have enhanced amino acids contents are available (QPM maize).
  \item
    Zincol, ZincShakti and Mayil in Wheat are enriched for protein and
    Zinc mineral. Similarly, recently notified lentil varieties Khajura
    Masuro-4 (ILL-7723) and Black masuro are high Zinc and iron
    containing genotypes.
