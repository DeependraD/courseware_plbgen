2. Albino is due to homozygote recessive allele, say aa. In a population consisting of 10000 babies there is one albino baby. What is the probability $(p)$ of *a* allele occuring in that population ?
3. Calculate the gametic and phenotypic frequencies of following individduals after selfing. Also, write the types of genotype and phenotype.
  - AAa
  - AAaa
