\begin{frame}{Background}
\protect\hypertarget{background}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Living beings produce more of their kind (procreate).
\item
  Rudolf Virchow, a German physician, put it this way in 1855,
  translating which in his latin axiom ``Omnis cellula e cellula,''
  meaning ``Every cell from a cell.''
\item
  Cell division enables unicellular organisms to reproduce and produce
  entire organism.
\item
  What goes on in eukaryotes cell cycle
\item
  Cell division involves distribution of identical genetic material, not
  merely the splitting of components.
\item
  Cell division copies DNA with high fidelity.
\item
  Functions:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Passing identical genetic material to cellular offspring.
  \item
    Breakdown of cell cycle plays a role in cancer development
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

(d) Nuclear region of an Allium cell, phase contrast (x3,100); chromatin and a nucleolus are in the nucleus, leucoplasts (two with pale starch-like inclusions), sausage-shaped mitochondria, and spherical oleosomes are in the cytoplasm}\label{fig:cell-structure-plant}

\begin{frame}{Organization of genetic material}
\protect\hypertarget{organization-of-genetic-material}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A cell's complete bulk of genetic information, DNA, is called its
  genome.
\item
  Although a prokaryotic genome is often a single DNA molecule,
  eukaryotic genomes usually consist of a number of DNA molecules.
\item
  Length of DNA = \textasciitilde{} 250, 000 times diameter of the cell
  that bears it.
\item
  When cell can divide to form genetically identical daughter cells, all
  of this DNA must be copied, or replicated, and then two copies must be
  separated so that each daughter cells ends up with a complete genome.
\item
  DNA is packaged into \textbf{chromosomes} ( \emph{chroma} and
  \emph{soma}).
\item
  The entire complex of DNA and proteins that is the building material
  of chromosomes is referred to as \textbf{chromatin}.
\item
  Most eukaryotic species have a characteristic number of chromosomes in
  each cell nucleus.

\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{../images/chromosome_structure} \caption{Chromosomes occur as compact entities during nuclear division (e.g., in metaphase and anaphase of mitosis). This entity is what was originally named 'chromosome.' (a) A satellite chromosome with the two telomeres, the centromere with the two kinetochores (insertion points of the microtubules on the spindle apparatus), heterochromatic bands (additional regions on the telomeres and in the region of the centromere), and the characteristic (for satellite chromosomes) nucleolar organizing region (NOR) and a heterochromatic satellite. The chromosome is split longitudinally into two chromatids that later become daughter chromosomes. (b) Anaphase chromosomes of barley (Hordeum vulgare) with a diploid chromosome number 2n = 28, two satellite chromosomes per complement. The four NORs and four satellites of the two complements of daughter chromosomes can be seen clearly (x1,880).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The chromosome complement in a cell nucleus in the members of a
  species is called their karyotype (records all the cytologically
  identifiable chromosome features (size, form, number)).
\item
  The karyotype is an important genetic, systematic, and phylogenetic
  characteristic.
\item
  The number of identical chromosome sets in a cell nucleus determines
  the level of ploidy, \emph{n}.
\item
  Cell nuclei with only one set of chromosomes are haploid ( \emph{1n};
  Greek \emph{haplos}, simple) somatic (tissue) cells are predominantly
  diploid ( \emph{2n}) in ferns and seed plants.
\item
  Gametic chromosome number = 1/2 x Somatic chromosome number
\item
  Nuclei of extraordinary size are mostly polyploid; they contain
  several to many copies of the gene and chromosome complement of the
  species in question.
\item
  Two compies of a chromosome are ordinarily identical in morphology,
  gene content and gene order; they are called \textbf{homologous
  chromosomes}.
\item
  Even artificially generated polyploid cell nuclei result in enlarged
  cells.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-3}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \textbf{C value} refers to the total amount of DNA in the haploid
  genome, given in picograms. The C value of the bacterium Escherichia
  coli is 0.004, that of tobacco is 1.6, that of maize is 7.5, and that
  of some lily species can be over 30.
\item
  The following chromosome features are particularly important: (Figure
  \ref{fig:chromosome-structure}) length, position of the centromere,
  presence or absence of a nucleolar organizing region (NOR), and
  heterochromatic sections.
\item
  Each metaphase chromosome appears to be longitudinally divided into
  two identical parts each of which is known as \textbf{chromatid}, a
  single is reffered to as sister chromatid.
\item
  The centromere (primary constriction; Greek kentron, middle point and
  meros, part) is the narrowest point on the chromosome, where the
  chromosome bends during chromosome movements in cell division and
  where the microtubules of the nuclear spindle attach.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-4}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  These microtubules end in a platelike or hemispherical multilayered
  structure that is located on the side of the centromere and is called
  kinetochore.
\item
  The part of a chromatid on either side of the centromere is referred
  to as an arm of the chromatid. (An uncondensed, unduplicated
  chromosome has a single centromere and two arms.)
\item
  Two arms of chromosome can range for values of lengths. The
  \textbf{centromere index} quantifies the length ratio of the arms
  (short arm length divided by the total chromosome length).
\item
  Based on the relative position of centromere on chromosomes, they can
  be:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Metacentric
  \item
    Submetacentric
  \item
    Acrocentric
  \item
    Telocentric
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-5}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Centromeric region of chromosome contains satellite DNA.
\item
  Telomeric region of chromosome is highly stable and has DNA loops.
\item
  The chromosome region lying between secondary constriction and the
  nearest telomere is known as satellite. Therefore chromosomes having
  secondary constrictions are called satellite chromosomes.
\item
  Nucleolus is always associated with the secondary constrictions of
  sat-chromosomes, thus these constrictions are sometimes also called
  NOR.
\item
  In some species e.g., maize, amphibia etc, chromosomes during first
  prophase of meiosis (pachytene), show small bead-like structures
  called chroommeres.
\item
  Homologous chromosomes always show identical pattern of chromomere
  distribution.

\item
  When a cell is not dividing, and even as it replicates its DNA in
  preparation for cell division, each chromosome is in the form of a
  long, thin chromatin fiber.
\item
  After DNA replication, however, the chromosomes condense as a part of
  cell division: Each chromatin fiber becomes densely coiled and folded,
  making the chromosomes much shorter and so thick that we can see them
  with a light microscope.
\item
  Each duplicated chromosome has two sister chromatids, which are joined
  copies of the original chromosome (Figure
  \ref{fig:duplicated-chromosome}).
\item
  The two chromatids, each containing an identical DNA molecule, are
  initially attached all along their lengths by protein complexes called
  cohesins.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-8}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each sister chromatid has a centromere, a region containing specific
  DNA sequences where the chromatid is attached most closely to its
  sister chromatid. This attachment is mediated by protein bound to the
  centromeric DNA sequences and gives the condensed, duplicated
  chromosome a narrow ``waist''.
\item
  Later in the cell division process, the two sister chromatids of each
  duplicated chromosomes separate and move into two new nuclei, one
  forming at each end of the cell. Once they separate they are
  considered individual chromosomes.

  \textbf{Mitosis} is the division of the genetic material in the
  nucleus, usually followed immediately by \textbf{cytokinesis}.
\item
  Walther Flemming coined the terms \emph{mitosis} and \emph{chromatin}.
\item
  Mitosis and cytokinesis produce cells that make up most of our bodies
  and same process continues to generate new cells to replace dead and
  damaged ones.
\item
  \textbf{Meiosis} occurs in humans only in gonads (ovaries or testes)
  to produce eggs or sperm.
\item
  In each division meiosis reduces the chromosome number from 46 (two
  sets of chromosomes) to 23 (one set), hence called the reductional
  division.
\item
  Fertilization fuses gametes together and returns chromosome number to
  46.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mitotic (M) phase, including both mitosis and cytokinesis, is the
  shortest part of a cell's life cycle.
\item
  M phase alternates with \textbf{interphase} (accounts for 90\% of the
  cycle).
\item
  Interphase can be divided into subphases (with time lapse for a normal
  human cell, about \textbf{24 hours}):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the \(\mathbf{G_1}\) phase (``first gap'') \(\longrightarrow\) 5-6
    hours,
  \item
    the S phase (``synthesis'') \(\longrightarrow\) 10-12 hours, and
  \item
    the \(\mathbf{G_2}\) phase (``second gap'') \(\longrightarrow\) 4-6
    hours.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  During all three subphases, a cell that will eventually divide grows
  by producing proteins and cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria
  and endoplasmic reticulum.
\item
  Chromosomes are duplicated only during the S phase.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Key events in mitosis}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mitotic spindle (consists of microtubules fibers and associated
  proteins) forms in the cytoplasm during prophase.
\item
  Spindle formation starts at centrosomes, division of which has occured
  during interphase.
\item
  An \textbf{aster}, a radial array of short microtubules extends from
  each centrosome.
\item
  Each of the two sister chromatids of a duplicated chromosome has a
  kinetochore, a structure of proteins associated with specific sections
  of chromosomal DNA at each centromere.
\end{itemize}

\caption{DNA and gene transmission in mitosis and meiosis in eukaryotes. The S phase and the main stages of mitosis and meiosis are shown. Mitotic divisions (left and middle) conserve the genotype of the original cell. At the right, the two successive meiotic divisions that take place during the sexual stage of the life cycle have the net effect of halving the number of chromosomes. The alleles A and a of one gene are used to show how genotypes are transmitted in cell division.}\label{fig:nuclear-division-dna}
