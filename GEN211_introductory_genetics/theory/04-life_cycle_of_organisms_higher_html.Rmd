# Drosophila

---

## Taxonomy and morpho-anatomy

- Taxonomic order Diptera in the family Drosophilidae. 
- The species is known generally as the common fruit fly or vinegar fly. 
- Charles W. Woodworth's proposed the use of this species as a model organism.
- D. melanogaster continues to be widely used for biological research in genetics, physiology, microbial pathogenesis, and life history evolution. As of 2017, six Nobel prizes had been awarded for research using Drosophila.
- D. melanogaster is typically used in research owing to its rapid life cycle, relatively simple genetics with only four pairs of chromosomes, and large number of offspring per generation.
- D. melanogaster is a common pest in homes, restaurants, and other places where food is served.

## Life cycle

- Under optimal growth conditions at 25 degree C, the D. melanogaster lifespan is about 50 days from egg to death.
- The developmental period for D. melanogaster varies with temperature, as with many ectothermic species. 
- The shortest development time (egg to adult), 7 days, is achieved at 28 degree C.[
- Development times increase at higher temperatures (11 days at 30 degree C) due to heat stress. 
- Under ideal conditions, the development time at 25 degree C is 8.5 days, at 18 degree C it takes 19 days and at 12 degree C it takes over 50 days.
- Under crowded conditions, development time increases, while the emerging flies are smaller.
- Females lay some 400 eggs (embryos), about five at a time, into rotting fruit or other suitable material such as decaying mushrooms and sap fluxes. 

---

- *Drosophila melanogaster* is a holometabolous insect, so it undergoes a full metamorphosis. 
- Their life cycle is broken down into 4 stages: embryo, larva, pupa, adult.
- The eggs, which are about 0.5 mm long, hatch after 12–15 hours (at 25 degree C).
- The resulting larvae grow for about 4 days (at 25 degree C) while molting twice (into second- and third-instar larvae), at about 24 and 48 h after hatching.
- During this time, they feed on the microorganisms that decompose the fruit, as well as on the sugar of the fruit itself. The mother puts feces on the egg sacs to establish the same microbial composition in the larvae's guts that has worked positively for herself.
- Then the larvae encapsulate in the puparium and undergo a 4-day-long metamorphosis (at 25 degree C), after which the adults emerge.

---

- Males perform a sequence of five behavioral patterns to court females. 
- First, males orient themselves while playing a courtship song by horizontally extending and vibrating their wings.
- Upon copulation, females store the sperm in a tubular receptacle and in two mushroom-shaped spermathecae; sperm from multiple matings compete for fertilization. 
- A last male precedence is believed to exist; the last male to mate with a female sires about 80% of her offspring. 
- This precedence was found to occur through both displacement and incapacitation.
- Sensory neurons in the uterus of female D. melanogaster respond to a male protein, sex peptide, which is found in semen.
- This protein makes the female reluctant to copulate for about 10 days after insemination. 
- Gonadotropic hormones in Drosophila maintain homeostasis and govern reproductive output via a cyclic interrelationship, not unlike the mammalian estrous cycle.
- Females become receptive to courting males about 8–12 hours after emergence.
- *D. melanogaster* males exhibit a strong reproductive learning curve. That is, with sexual experience, these flies tend to modify their future mating behavior in multiple ways. These changes include increased selectivity for courting only intraspecifically, as well as decreased courtship times.

## Laboratory use of D. melanogaster

- Its care and culture require little equipment, space, and expense even when using large cultures.

--

- It can be safely and readily anesthetized (usually with ether, carbon dioxide gas, by cooling, or with products such as FlyNap).

--

- Its morphology is easy to identify once anesthetized.

--

- It has a short generation time (about 10 days at room temperature), so several generations can be studied within a few weeks.

--

- It has a high fecundity (females lay up to 100 eggs per day, and perhaps 2000 in a lifetime).

--

- Males and females are readily distinguished, and virgin females are easily isolated, facilitating genetic crossing.

--

- The mature larva has giant chromosomes in the salivary glands called polytene chromosomes, "puffs", which indicate regions of transcription, hence gene activity. The under-replication of rDNA occurs resulting in only 20% of DNA compared to the brain. Compare to the 47%, less rDNA in Sarcophaga barbata ovaries.

---

- It has only four pairs of chromosomes – three autosomes, and one pair of sex chromosomes.

--

- Males do not show meiotic recombination, facilitating genetic studies.

--

- Recessive lethal "balancer chromosomes" carrying visible genetic markers can be used to keep stocks of lethal alleles in a heterozygous state without recombination due to multiple inversions in the balancer.

--

- The development of this organism—from fertilized egg to mature adult—is well understood.

--

- Genetic transformation techniques have been available since 1987.

--

- Its complete genome was sequenced and first published in 2000.<sup>1</sup>

--

- Sexual mosaics can be readily produced, providing an additional tool for studying the development and behavior of these flies.

## Drosophila genetics

- The genome of D. melanogaster (sequenced in 2000, and curated at the FlyBase database) contains four pairs of chromosomes – an X/Y pair, and three autosomes labeled 2, 3, and 4. 
- The fourth chromosome is so tiny, it is often ignored, aside from its important eyeless gene. The D. melanogaster sequenced genome of 139.5 million base pairs has been annotated and contains around 15,682 genes according to Ensemble release 73.
- More than 60% of the genome appears to be functional non-protein-coding DNA involved in gene expression control. Determination of sex in Drosophila occurs by the X:A ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, not because of the presence of a Y chromosome as in human sex determination. Although the Y chromosome is entirely heterochromatic, it contains at least 16 genes, many of which are thought to have male-related functions.

- Chromosome number (2n): 40; n=20
- The haploid genome is about 3 picograms, similar to humans.
- Unlike the mostly metacentric chromosomes of humans, all mouse chromosomes are acrocentric.
- Haploid chromosome contains 3.1 billion base pairs long
- Genome length (3000 mb distributed over 19 autosomes plus one and two sex chromosome).
- The primary coding genes are 23,139 out of which 20210 protein coding genes are found.

## Morphology

- A mouse is a small with pointed nose, furry round body, large ears and a long often hairless tail.
- There are hundred types of mice divided into subfamilies of either old World or new world species. 
- Common varieties includes deermouse, housemouse, wood mouse, spingmose and zebramouse.
- Colour of mouse ranges from white,brown to grey
- Length: 1 to 7 inches
- Weigtht: 0.23kg to 0.28kg
- Smallest mouse: African pygmy measure (1.2-3.1 inches).
- Some mice have tail that are as long as their body.

---

## Reproduction

- Mus musculus is characterized by tremendus reproductive potential. 
- Breeding occurs through out the year. A single female is capable of producing up to eight litters per year. Female can reproduce up to ten times per year.
- Female go into heat for four to five days. Once pregnant, rodent gives birth after three weeks.
- At about 21 days, the young are weaned from their mothers and may begin to take short trips away from nest to explore their surroundings.
 - Most mice reach sexual maturity at about 35 days age and begin start matting when they are six weeks old.

---

## Suitability

- A model organism is a species that has been widely studied, usually because it is easy to maintain and breed in a laboratory setting and has particular experimental advantages.
- Mus musculus represents humans and a broad range of mammals as they are closely related in terms of anatomy, physiology and genetics.
- They are widely used as disease models for humans.
- They can breed large number of off-spring in a short period of time.
- The similar sized gene/genome of mouse and humans gave preference to mouse in genetic studies.
- They are easy to look after and care and are cost effective.
- The time between a mouse being born and giving birth is short, usually around 10 weeks. Thus several generations can be observed at once.
- Immunodeficient mice can also be used as hosts to grow both normal and diseased normal human tissue. This has been a useful tools in cancer and AIDS research.

---

## Studies

- William Harvey studied blood circulation and reproduction in 16th century.
- Gregor Mendel carried out his early investigations of inheritance on mouse coat color but was asked by his superior to stop breeding in his cell "smelly creatures that, in addition, copulated and had sex"
- Frederick Griffith in 1928 conducted an experiment on mouse and found that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as transformation.
- In 1902 Lucien Cue'not published the results of his experiments using mice which showed that Mendel's laws of inheritance were also valid for animals.
- Mouse has been used as a biological model from early 20th century as the three inbred lines DBA (dilute, brown and non-agouti colored) were discovered.
- In recent studies, researches have generated blastocyst like structure from stem cell; blastocyst like structure resemble very closely to real blastocysts.
- Methods have been developed for successfully generating hair growth in nude mice, this has a potential hair loss treatment in human.
- Study have related good health in mice to plenty of _Clostiridia_ in its gut, at the same time those with an impaired immune system lose their microbes from their gut as they age.

- Lower plants have haploid condition for the major part of the life cycle, with different haploid mating types producing the gametes that combine to form a diploid zygote.
- Propagation of diploid chromosome constitution of a zygote to a later stage of life cycle is called the sporophytic generation because some diploid cells (sporocytes) undergo meiosis to form haploid spores (sporogenesis).
- These spores, although not gametes, multiply mitotically to yield the gametophytes (haploid male and female stages) which, in turn, form gametes.
- In maize (or angiosperms), as the plants reach in this progression, the haploid gametophytes are reduced in size as to be microscopic.

- In corn two types of gametophytes are represented by small **microspores** in the stamens (found in tassels), and by large **megaspores** in the pistils (found in developing ears).
- In stamen single diploid microspore mother cell cell (**PMC**) divide meiotically to yield four haploid microspores, each becoming encapsulated as a pollen grain (the **male gametophyte**), the haploid pollen then divides mitotically to form a **tube nucleus** and a **generative nucleus**.
- In pistils similar event occur in each megaspore mother cell (**MMC**), except that only one of four haploid macrospore nuclei becomes functional occupant of the **embryo sac** (the **female gametophyte**). The nuclei of this cell divides mitotically into two daughter nuclei, which divide twice more, forming a total of eight haploid nuclei, four at each end of the embryo sac.

- A single nucleus from each end group of the four then unites at the center to form the diploid endosperm nucleus. 
- Of the remaining six nuclei in the embryo sac, the group of three farthest away from the pollen tube point of entry (**micropyle**) are called the **antipodal** cells, while the other group differentiates into a single **female gametic nucleus** and two **synergids**.
- In the process of fertilization, the pollen grain makes contact with the stigma (silk) of the pistil and then germinates into a long **pollen tube** carrying the two male sperm nuclei to the embryo sac.
- One male gamete fertilizes the female gametic nucleus to form the diploid zygote, and the other male gamete combines with the diploid endosperm to form triploid tissue that will nourish the embryo. This constitutes the **double fertilization**.
