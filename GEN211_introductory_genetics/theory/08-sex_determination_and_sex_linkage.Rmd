# Sex determination

##

- A sex-determination system is a biological system that determines the development of sexual characteristics in an organism.
- Most organisms that create their offspring using sexual reproduction have two sexes.
- Occasionally, there are hermaphrodites in place of one or both sexes. There are also some species that are only one sex due to parthenogenesis, the act of a \female reproducing without fertilization.
- Sexual orientation of individual flowers and plants may be:
  - Flower: Unisexual and bisexual
  - Individual: Monoecious, dieoeious and hermaphrodite
- In many species, sex determination is genetic: males and females have different alleles or even different genes that specify their sexual morphology. 
- In animals this is often accompanied by chromosomal differences, generally through combinations of XY, ZW, XO, ZO chromosomes, or haplodiploidy.
- X and Y chromosomes can be divided into homologous and differential regions.

<!-- - The sexual differentiation is generally triggered by a main gene (a "sex locus"), with a multitude of other genes following in a domino effect.  -->

# Mechanisms of sex determination 

## Environmental sex determination

- In some cases, sex of a fetus is determined by environmental factors (e.g. temperature)
- Some species such as various plants and fish do not have a fixed sex, and instead go through life cycles and change sex based on genetic cues during corresponding life stages of their type. 
- This could be due to environmental factors,
  - Seasons
  - Association with \female
  - Egg size
  - Incubation temperature

##

- Larvae of sea worm _Bonelia_ are sexually undifferentiated. Those larvae thaat attach to the proboscis of \female worms develop into \male s. In contrast, those larvae that do not attach to \female worms and remain free develop into \female s.
- In sea worm _Dinophilus_, animals developed from eggs of relatively larger size are \female s, while those obtained from smaller eggs are \male s.
- Animals like turtles, alligators and crocodiles respond to egg incubation temperature during embryonic stages for differentiation. In some cases:
  - High ($30-35^\circ$) temperature produces only \female s, 
  - Low ($23-28^\circ$) temperature produce only \male s, and
  - Intermediate temperature ($28-30^\circ$) might give rise to both \male s and \female s.

## Chromosomal sex determination

\small

- In a vast majority of animals, \male and \female individuals ordinarily differ from each other in respect of either the number or the **morphology of the homologues of one chromosome pair**.
- This chromosome is reffered to as sex chromosome or allosome.
- There are 2 types of sex chromosome, X and Y. 
- **X chromosome** is found in both \male s and \female s, although one sex has only one, while the other sex has two X chromosomes.
- **Y chromosome** ordinarily occurs only in one of the two sexes of a species, e.g., \male mice, drosophila, humans, \female birds, reptiles, etc.
- Y chromosome contains mostly heterochromatin while X chromosome contains euchromatin.
- Different mechanisms of chromosomal sex determination are:
  1. XX \female, X0 \male
  2. X0 \female, XX \male
  3. XX \female, XY \male
  4. XY \female, XX \male
  5. diploid (2n) \female, haploid (n) \male

## XX/XO sex chromosome (Chromosomal sex determination)

- In grasshoppers, _Protenor_ and other orthopteran insects, \female s have two X chromosomes, while males have only one X (XX \female, X0 \male).
  - Thus somatic cell of \female s have one chromosome more than those of \male s.
  - Females are homogametic sex and \male s are heterogametic sex.
  - Union of a sperm having an X chromosome with any egg produces a zygote having two X chromomsomes (XX); such zygote develop into \female individuals. But when a sperm without an X chromosome fertilizes an eg, an XO zygote is obtained; such individuals would develop into males.
- In Fumea, females have only one X chromosome while males have two X chromosomes (X0 \female, XX \male)

## XX/XY chromosome

- XX \female, XY \male
  - The system is found in most other mammals, as well as some insects (Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Diptera), some fishes and some amphibia. 
  - In this system, most females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), while most males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY).
  - In some species, such as humans, organisms remain sex indifferent for a time after they're created; in others, however, such as fruit flies, sexual differentiation occurs as soon as the egg is fertilized.
  - \female are homogametic and males are heterogametic sex
- XY \female, XX \male
  - The system is operates in some birds, reptiles, some insects, e.g. silkworm, etc.
  - \male are homogametic and females are heterogametic sex.

## X or Y-centered sex determination

- In Y-centered sex determination, the SRY gene (residing on the Y chromosome) is the main gene in determining \male characteristics, but multiple genes are required to develop testes. Members of SRY-reliant species can have uncommon XY chromosomal combinations such as XXY and still live.
- Some species, such as fruit flies, use the presence of two X chromosomes to determine femaleness. Species that use the number of Xs to determine sex are nonviable with an extra X chromosome.
- Some fish have variants of the XY sex-determination system, as well as the regular system. For example, while having an XY format, _Xiphophorus nezahualcoyotl_ and X. milleri also have a second Y chromosome, known as Y', that creates XY' females and YY' males.
- The platypus has ten sex chromosomes; males have an XYXYXYXYXY pattern while females have ten X chromosomes.

## Haplodiploidy

- Mostly in hymenoptera, e.g. honey-bees, ants, termites females are diploid 2n and males are haploid (n)
- During spermatogenesis, all the n chromosomes of males regularly pass to a single pole at Anaphase I so that the opposite pole receives no chromosome. Thus all the sperms are regularly haploid.
- Normal oogenesis produces all haploid eggs.
- Fertilization of eggs produces diploid zygotes, which develop into diploid larvae.
  - Such larvae give rise to workers, which are sterile females.
  - Females fed on royal jelly develop into fertile females called queen.
- Unfertilized eggs develop parthenogenically to produce haploid larvae and ultimately fully fertile haploid males called drones.

# Molecular basis of sex determination

## Geneic balance theory

- Bridges discovered XXY females and X0 males in _Drosophila_ while studying inheritance of vermilion eye gene in the X chromosome.
- This showed that XX and XY chromosome constitutions are not essential for femaleness and maleness, respectively, and that Y chromosome did not play a role in sex determination.
- Triploid females mated with normal diploid males result in aneuploid progeny. The progeny from such cross showed five different sex expressions. 
- By correlating the sex of an individual with its chromosome constitution, Bridges developed the geneic balance theory of sex determination. This theory fully explains sex determination in _Drosophila_.

$$
\text{Sex index} = \frac{\text{Number of X chromosomes}}{\text{Number of autosomal sets}} = \frac{X}{A}
$$

```{r geneic-balance}
crossing("Ploidy" = c("2n", "3n", "4n"), "Number of X chromosomes" = c(1, 2, 3, 4)) %>% 
  mutate("Number of autosomal sets" = as.integer(str_extract(Ploidy, "\\d")), 
         "Sex index (X/A)" = `Number of X chromosomes`/`Number of autosomal sets`) %>%

# Sex determination in plants

## Mechanisms

- Environmental: _Equisetum sp._
- Chromosomal:
  - Homomorphic chromosomes: Heterogametic \male ( _Asparagus_, Spinach), Heterogametic \female ( _Frageria elateria_)
  - Heteromorphic chromosomes: Heterogametic \male ( Active Y: _Silene latifolia_, X/autosome balance: _Rumex acetosa_, X1X1X2X2 - X1X2Y1Y2: _Humulus lupulus_)
- Genic:
  - Single gene: _Ecballium elaterium_
  - Muliple gene: _Mercurialis annua_

## Genic sex determination in Papaya

- In papaya, a single gene with three alleles ($m, M_1 and M_2$) is suggested to control the sex of an individual. \female plants are homozygous $mm$, while \male plants are heterozygous $M_1m$; the heterozygote $M_2m$ produces hermaphrodite condition. Genotypes $M_1M_1$, $M_1M_2$ and $M_2M_2$ are inviable (Table \ref{tab:papaya-sex-determination}).

# Sex linkage

##

- Sex linkage is the patterns of inheritance and presentation when a gene mutation (allele) is present on a sex chromosome (allosome) rather than a non-sex chromosome (autosome). 
- They are characteristically different from the autosomal forms of dominance and recessiveness as they are different depending on the sex of the individual.
- Since humans have several times as many genes on the \female X chromosome than on the \male Y chromosome, X-linked traits are much more common than Y-linked traits. 

##

```{r sex-linked-inheritance-drosophila, fig.cap="Experiment performed by Morgan on Drosophila"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/sex_linked_inheritance_drosophila.png")
```


## X-linked traits

- Additionally, there are more X-linked recessive conditions than X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive conditions affect males much more commonly, due to males only having the one X chromosome required for the condition to present.
- In humans, X-linked traits are inherited from a carrier or affected mother or from an affected father.
- A daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier, however a son born to an affected father and a non-carrier mother will always be unaffected due to not inheriting the father's X chromosome. A daughter in that case, on the other hand will always be a carrier.
- Unless the condition is dominant she will not be always affected.
- The incidence of X-linked recessive conditions in females is the square of that in males: for example, if 1 in 20 males in a human population are red-green color blind, then 1 in 400 females in the population are expected to be color-blind (1/20)*(1/20).
- In classical genetics, a mating experiment called a reciprocal cross is performed to test if an animal's trait is sex-linked.

```{r x-dominant-affected-father, fig.cap="\\textbf{Illustration of some X-linked heredity outcomes} \\newline (A) the affected father has one X-linked dominant allele, the mother is homozygous for the recessive allele: only daughters (all) will be affected. (B) the affected mother is heterozygous with one copy of the X-linked dominant allele: both daughters and sons will have 50\\% probability to be affected. (C) the heterozygous mother is called 'carrier' because she has one copy of the recessive allele: sons will have 50\\% probability to be affected, 50\\% of unaffected daughters will become carriers like their mother.", out.width="32%", fig.align='center'}

```

## X-linked dominant inheritance

- Each child of a mother affected with an X-linked dominant trait has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation and thus being affected with the disorder. 
- If only the father is affected, 100% of the daughters will be affected, since they inherit their father's X chromosome, and 0% of the sons will be affected, since they inherit their father's Y chromosome.
- There are less X-linked dominant conditions than X-linked recessive, because dominance in X-linkage requires the condition to present with only a fraction of the gene expression of autosomal dominance, since roughly half (or as many as 90% in some cases) of a particular parent's X chromosomes are inactivated in females.
- Example: Coffin-Lowry Syndrom (CLS), Fragile X syndrome, Vitamin D resistant rickets

## X-linked recessive inheritance

- Females possessing one X-linked recessive mutation are considered carriers and will generally not manifest clinical symptoms of the disorder, although differences in X chromosome inactivation can lead to varying degrees of clinical expression in carrier females since some cells will express one X allele and some will express the other. 
- All males possessing an X-linked recessive mutation will be affected, since males have only a single X chromosome and therefore have only one copy of X-linked genes. 
- All offspring of a carrier \female have a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation if the father does not carry the recessive allele. 
- All \female children of an affected father will be carriers (assuming the mother is not affected or a carrier), as daughters possess their father's X chromosome.
- If the mother is not a carrier, no \male children of an affected father will be affected, as males only inherit their father's Y chromosome. 
- Examples: Color blindness, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Haemophilia A and B, Hunter syndrome, Inherited nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, etc.

## Y-linked

- Various failures in SRY genes

## Sex-linked traits in other animals

- White eyes in Drosophila melanogaster flies—the first sex-linked gene discovered.
- Fur color in domestic cats: the gene that causes orange pigment is on the X chromosome; thus a Calico or tortoiseshell cat, with both black (or gray) and orange pigment, is nearly always \female.
- The first sex-linked gene ever discovered was the "lacticolor" X-linked recessive gene in the moth Abraxas grossulariata by Leonard Doncaster

## Sex-influenced traits

Sex-influenced or sex-conditioned traits are phenotypes affected by whether they appear in a \male or \female body. Even in a homozygous dominant or recessive \female the condition may not be expressed fully. Example: baldness in humans.

## Sex-limited traits

These are characters only expressed in one sex. They may be caused by genes on either autosomal or sex chromosomes. Examples: \female sterility in Drosophila; and many polymorphic characters in insects, especially in relation to mimicry. Closely linked genes on autosomes called "supergenes" are often responsible for the latter.

# Numerical problems

## Problem 2: Sex linked inheritance

- A sex-linked recessive allele $c$ produces a red-green color blindness in humans. A normal woman whose father was color blind marries a color-blind man.
  a. What genotypes are possible for the mother of the color blind man ?
  b. What are the chances that the first child from this marriage will be a color-blind boy ?
  c. Of the girls produced by these parents, what proportion can be expected to be color blind ?
  d. Of all the children (sex unspecified) of these parents, what proportion can be expected to have normal color vision ?
  
## Solution 2: Sex linked inheritance

a. $X^C/X^c, X^c/X^c$
b. p (color-blind) x p (\male) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4
c. The girls will be 1 normal ($X^C/X^c$): 1 color-blind ($X^c/X^c$).
d. The cross is $X^C/X^c \times X^c/Y$, yielding 1 normal:1 color-blind for both sexes.
