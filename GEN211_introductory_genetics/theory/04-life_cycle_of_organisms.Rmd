# Escherichia coli

##

- _E.coli_ is a gram negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms.
- _E.coli_ is the most widely studied prokaryotic unicellular model organism. 
- Most _E.coli_ strains are harmless, but some can cause serious food poisoning. Shiga toxin-producing _E.coli_ (STEC) is a bacterium that can cause severe foodborne disease.
- Can grow with or without oxygen. 
- _E.coli_ is about 2.0 micrometer long and 0.25-1.0 micrometer in diameter with a cell volume of 0.6-0.7 micro cubic meter.

## Taxonomy and classification


## Morphology

- Bacteria is arranged singly or in pairs.
- It is motile due to peritrichous flagella.
- Some strains are non-motile. 
- Some strains may be fimbriated. 
- The fimbriae are of type 1 (hemagglutinating and mannose-sensitive) and are present in both motile and non-motile strains.
- ome strains of _E. coli_ isolated from extra-intestinal infections have polysaccharide capsule.
- They are non-sporing.
They have thin cell wall with only 1 or 2 layers of peptidoglycan.
- They are facultative anaerobes.
- Growth occurs over a wide range of temperature from $15-45^{\circ}C$.

## Genetics

- Genome size :4.6Mb
- Chromosomes:Circular
- No.of genes:4000
- Percentage with human chromosomes:8%
- Average gene density: 
- Gene sequenced:1997

## Reproduction

- _E.coli_ reproduces by two meams:
  - cell division
  - the transfer of genetic material through a sex pilus (conjugation).
- It takes about fourty minutes to make one complete copy of the _E.coli_ genome.Therefore each generation of _E.coli_ should last just under on hour.
- Instead _E.coli_ can divide (under ideal condition) in as little as 20 minutes.
- Prokaryotes reproduce asexually through binary fission.
- The cell divides leaving two copies of original bacterium called daughter cells 

## Studies

- A German pediatrician named Odor Escheriehia in 1885 discovered _E.coli_ in the faeces of healthy individual and named it Bacterium coli because of the fact that it is found in the colon.
- Early prokaryotic classification based on their motility and shape
- Afterwards E.haeckel's bacteria classification placed bacteria in the monera kingdom
- In 1985 Migula reclassified bacteria in the genus Escheria which was named  so after its discover. This genus belongs to the bacterial group formally called 'coliforms' which are member of the enterics known as Enterubacterialeae family
- Because of its long history of laboratory culture and ease of manipulation _E.coli_ plays an important role in modern biological egineering and industrial microbiology.

## Suitability as model organism

- Rapid reproduction and small size
- Under optimal condition,they can reproduce every 20 minutes,in a mere 7 hours, a single bacterial cells can give rise to more than 2million descendents.
- Thus enormous numbers of cells can be grown quickly,so that even very rare mutations will appear in a short period of time.
- Consequently,numerous mutations in _E.coli_ everything from colony appearance to drug resistance, have been isolated and characterised.
- _E.coli_ is easy to culture in the laboratory in liquid medium or on solid medium within petri plates.
- In liquid culture, _E.coli_ cells will grow to a concentration of a billion cells per millilitre and trillion of bacterial cells can be easily grown on a single test tube.

##

- When _E.coli_ cells are dilluted and spread onto the solid medium of a petridish, individual bacteria reproduce asexually, giving rise to a concentrated clump of 10 million - 100 million genetically identical cells called a colony.
- This colony formation makes it easy to isolate genetically pure strains of the bacteria
- One of the first useful  applications of recombinant DNA technology was the manipulation of _E.coli_ to produce human insulin
- Modified _E.coli_ has been used  in  vaccine development, bioremediation, production of biofuels, lightening and production  of immobilised enzymes 
- _E.coli_ is a very versatile host for the production of heterogenous protein and protein expression systems have been developed which allow the production of recombinant proteins in _E.coli_.
- Researches can introduce genes into the microbes using plasmids which permits high level expression of protein and such protein may be mass produced in industrial fermentation processes

# Caenorhabditis elegans

## Introduction

- _Caenorhabditis elegans_ is a free-living, transparent nematode, about 1 mm in length, that lives in temperate soil environments.
- In 1955, Dougherty raised Caenorhabditis to the status of genus.
- _C. elegans_ is an unsegmented pseudocoelomate and lacks respiratory or circulatory systems.
- Most of these nematodes are **hermaphrodites** and a few are males. 
- Males have specialised tails for mating that include spicules. 
- In 1963, Sydney Brenner proposed research into _C. elegans_ primarily in the area of neuronal development. In 1974, he began research into the molecular and developmental biology of _C. elegans_, which has since been extensively used as a model organism.
- It was the first multicellular organism to have its whole genome sequenced, and as of 2012, is the only organism to have its connectome (neuronal "wiring diagram") completed.

## Taxonomy and classification



## Morpho-anatomy of adult and lifecycle of worm

- The wild‐type nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has an elongated and spindle‐shaped body, whereas the dumpy mutant has a shorter body with approximately the same diameter.
- A temperature‐sensitive morphological mutant which develops into an adult with dumpy phenotype, at $15^{\circ}C$, but with roller phenotype at $25^{\circ}C$, in addition to dumpy phenotype, was isolated.
- The heterozygous offspring (F1), produced by crossing the mutant hermaphrodite with wild‐type males, were rollers in both hermaphrodites and males.

[Image of adult]

- It has a cuticle (a tough outer covering, as an exoskeleton), four main epidermal cords, and a fluid-filled pseudocoelom (body cavity). 
- It also has some of the same organ systems as larger animals. About one in a thousand individuals is male and the rest are hermaphrodites.
- The basic anatomy of _C. elegans_ includes a mouth, pharynx, intestine, gonad, and collagenous cuticle.
- The basic anatomy of C. elegans includes a mouth, pharynx, intestine, gonad, and collagenous cuticle.
- The pharynx is a muscular food pump in the head of C. elegans, which is triangular in cross-section. This grinds food and transports it directly to the intestine.
- Males have a single-lobed gonad, a vas deferens, and a tail specialized for mating, which incorporates spicules. 
- Hermaphrodites have two ovaries, oviducts, and spermatheca, and a single uterus.

[Lifecycle]

## Genetics

- The genome sequence was published in 1998, although some small gaps were present; the last gap was finished by October 2002.
- Neurons of humans and _C. elegans_ are almost identical. Both human and C. elegans neurons contain a dendrite which extends from the cell to receive neurotransmitters, and extends to the nerve ring or brain for a synaptic connection between neurons.
- The biggest difference is that _C. elegans_ has motor excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
- The _C. elegans_ genome is about 100 million base pairs long and consists of six chromosomes and a mitochondrial genome.
- Its gene density is about one gene per five kilo-base pairs. Introns make up 26% and intergenic regions 47% of the genome.
- _C. elegans_ and other nematodes are among the few eukaryotes currently known to have operons; these include trypanosomes, flatworms (notably the trematode Schistosoma mansoni), and a primitive chordate tunicate .
- The genome contains an estimated 20,470 protein-coding genes. About 35% of _C. elegans_ genes have human homologs. 
- Remarkably, human genes have been shown repeatedly to replace their _C. elegans_ homologs when introduced into _C. elegans_. Conversely, many _C. elegans_ genes can function similarly to mammalian genes.The number of known RNA genes in the genome has increased greatly due to the 2006 discovery of a new class of 21U-RNA genes, and the genome is now believed to contain more than 16,000 RNA genes, up from as few as 1,300 in 2005.
- As of 2014, C. elegans is the most basal species in the 'Elegans' group (10 species) of the 'Elegans' supergroup (17 species) in phylogenetic studies. It forms a branch of its own distinct to any other species of the group.

## Reproduction

- The hermaphroditic worm is considered to be a specialized form of self-fertile female, as its soma is female. 
- The hermaphroditic germline produces male gametes first, and lays eggs through its uterus after internal fertilization.
- Hermaphrodites produce all their sperm in the L4 stage (150 sperm cells per gonadal arm) and then produce only oocytes.
- The hermaphroditic gonad acts as an ovotestis with sperm cells being stored in the same area of the gonad as the oocytes until the first oocyte pushes the sperm into the spermatheca (a chamber wherein the oocytes become fertilized by the sperm).
- Once a male recognizes hermaphrodite worm, it begins tracing the hermaphrodite with his tail until it reaches the vulval region. The male then probes the region with its spicules to locate the vulva, inserts them, and releases sperm.

## Studies

- First studied in the laboratory by Victor Nigon and Ellsworth Dougherty in the 1940s.
- Adopted by Sydney Brenner in 1963 as a model organism for the study of developmental biology using genetics.
- In the 1980s, John Sulston and co-workers identified the lineage of all 959 cells in the adult hermaphrodite, the first genes were cloned, and the physical map began to be constructed.
- Notable research using _C. elegans_ includes the discoveries of caspases, RNA interference, and microRNAs. Six scientists have won the Nobel prize for their work on _C. elegans_.
- _C. elegans_ made news when specimens were discovered to have survived the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster in February 2003.

# Mus musculus

##

- _Mus musculus_ is a small mammal of the order Rodentia, characteristically having a pointed snout, large rounded ears, and a long and hairy tail.
- Mouses dates long back on the genetic research as a model organism
- Out of the order rodentia mouse is a orgamism with short breeding period.
- They are widely used to study human genetic disorders (downs syndrome, cystic fibrosis, epilepsy, heart diseases, cancers, tumours and many more).

## Classification and taxonomy

## Genetics

- The complete mouse genome was discovered in 2002 AD.
- Chromosome number (2n): 40; n=20
- The haploid genome is about 3 picograms, similar to humans.
- Unlike the mostly metacentric chromosomes of humans, all mouse chromosomes are acrocentric.
- Haploid chromosome contains 3.1 billion base pairs long
- Genome length (3000 mb distributed over 19 autosomes plus one and two sex chromosome).
- The primary coding genes are 23,139 out of which 20210 protein coding genes are found.

## Chromosomes

[Images]

## Morphology

- A mouse is a small with pointed nose, furry round body, large ears and a long often hairless tail.
- There are hundred types of mice divided into subfamilies of either old World or new world species. 
- Common varieties includes deermouse, housemouse, wood mouse, spingmose and zebramouse.
- Colour of mouse ranges from white,brown to grey
- Length: 1 to 7 inches
- Weigtht: 0.23kg to 0.28kg
- Smallest mouse: African pygmy measure (1.2-3.1 inches).
- Some mice have tail that are as long as their body.

## Reproduction

- Mus musculus is characterized by tremendus reproductive potential. 
- Breeding occurs through out the year. A single female is capable of producing up to eight litters per year. Female can reproduce up to ten times per year.
- Female go into heat for four to five days. Once pregnant, rodent gives birth after three weeks.
- At about 21 days, the young are weaned from their mothers and may begin to take short trips away from nest to explore their surroundings.
 - Most mice reach sexual maturity at about 35 days age and begin start matting when they are six weeks old.

## Suitability

- A model organism is a species that has been widely studied, usually because it is easy to maintain and breed in a laboratory setting and has particular experimental advantages.
- Mus musculus represents humans and a broad range of mammals as they are closely related in terms of anatomy, physiology and genetics.
- They are widely used as disease models for humans.
- They can breed large number of off-spring in a short period of time.
- The similar sized gene/genome of mouse and humans gave preference to mouse in genetic studies.
- They are easy to look after and care and are cost effective.
- The time between a mouse being born and giving birth is short, usually around 10 weeks. Thus several generations can be observed at once.
- Immunodeficient mice can also be used as hosts to grow both normal and diseased normal human tissue. This has been a useful tools in cancer and AIDS research.

## Studies

- William Harvey studied blood circulation and reproduction in 16th century.
- Gregor Mendel carried out his early investigations of inheritance on mouse coat color but was asked by his superior to stop breeding in his cell "smelly creatures that, in addition, copulated and had sex"
- Frederick Griffith in 1928 conducted an experiment on mouse and found that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as transformation.
- In 1902 Lucien Cue'not published the results of his experiments using mice which showed that Mendel's laws of inheritance were also valid for animals.
- Mouse has been used as a biological model from early 20th century as the three inbred lines DBA (dilute, brown and non-agouti colored) were discovered.
- In recent studies, researches have generated blastocyst like structure from stem cell; blastocyst like structure resemble very closely to real blastocysts.
- Methods have been developed for successfully generating hair growth in nude mice, this has a potential hair loss treatment in human.
- Study have related good health in mice to plenty of _Clostiridia_ in its gut, at the same time those with an impaired immune system lose their microbes from their gut as they age.

##

- Lower plants have haploid condition for the major part of the life cycle, with different haploid mating types producing the gametes that combine to form a diploid zygote.
- Propagation of diploid chromosome constitution of a zygote to a later stage of life cycle is called the sporophytic generation because some diploid cells (sporocytes) undergo meiosis to form haploid spores (sporogenesis).
- These spores, although not gametes, multiply mitotically to yield the gametophytes (haploid male and female stages) which, in turn, form gametes.
- In maize (or angiosperms), as the plants reach in this progression, the haploid gametophytes are reduced in size as to be microscopic.

##

- In corn two types of gametophytes are represented by small **microspores** in the stamens (found in tassels), and by large **megaspores** in the pistils (found in developing ears).
- In stamen single diploid microspore mother cell cell (**PMC**) divide meiotically to yield four haploid microspores, each becoming encapsulated as a pollen grain (the **male gametophyte**), the haploid pollen then divides mitotically to form a **tube nucleus** and a **generative nucleus**.
- In pistils similar event occur in each megaspore mother cell (**MMC**), except that only one of four haploid macrospore nuclei becomes functional occupant of the **embryo sac** (the **female gametophyte**). The nuclei of this cell divides mitotically into two daughter nuclei, which divide twice more, forming a total of eight haploid nuclei, four at each end of the embryo sac.

```

##

- A single nucleus from each end group of the four then unites at the center to form the diploid endosperm nucleus. 
- Of the remaining six nuclei in the embryo sac, the group of three farthest away from the pollen tube point of entry (**micropyle**) are called the **antipodal** cells, while the other group differentiates into a single **female gametic nucleus** and two **synergids**.
- In the process of fertilization, the pollen grain makes contact with the stigma (silk) of the pistil and then germinates into a long **pollen tube** carrying the two male sperm nuclei to the embryo sac.
- One male gamete fertilizes the female gametic nucleus to form the diploid zygote, and the other male gamete combines with the diploid endosperm to form triploid tissue that will nourish the embryo. This constitutes the **double fertilization**.
