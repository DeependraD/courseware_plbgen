# Numerical problems

1. Calculate gametic and phenotypic frequencies of AAaa individual after selfing. Also write the types of genotype and phenotype.
2. Albino is due to homozygote recessive allele, say aa. In a population consisting of 10000 babies there is one albino baby. What is the probability $(p)$ of *a* allele occuring in that population ?
3. Calculate the gametic and phenotypic frequencies of following individduals after selfing. Also, write the types of genotype and phenotype.
  - AAa
  - AAaa
4. In a family with 5 children, what is the probability that it has 3 boys and 2 girls among them.
5. In maize, recessive gene ba produces barren cob and ts gene converts male flower into female flower. Ba and Ts are the dominant genes and together they give the normal cob and male flower respectively. A genetician crossed a plant having genotype BabaTsts with other plant haivng genotype BaBaTsts. Show this cross and determine the sex expression in the progeny.

3. Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome

## Klinefelter syndrome

- Also known as 47, XXY or XXY, is the symptom that result from two or more X chromosomes in males.
- Primary features are: infertility and small testicles.
- Symptoms may be subtle and often non observable.
- Other symptoms may include: weaker muscles, greater height, poor coordination, less body hair, breast growth and lesser sexual interest.
- Symptoms are more severe if three or more X chromosomes are present XXXY, or XXXXY syndrome.

## Turner syndrome

- also known 45, X, is a genetic condition in which a female is partly or completely missing an X chromosome. 
- Signs and symptoms vary among those affected. Often, a short and webbed neck, low-set ears, low hairline at the back of the neck, short stature, and swollen hands and feet are seen at birth.
- They show impaird reproductive system (infertile) unless assisted with hormone treatment.

- Both the types of syndromes (Turner and Klinefelter) are non-inherited disorders.
