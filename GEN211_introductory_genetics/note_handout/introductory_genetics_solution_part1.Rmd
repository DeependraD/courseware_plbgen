What are the reasons for obtaining hermaphrodite goat population in Chitwan ?

\bsolution

Hermaphrodity in Goat poulation may be due to one or multiple reasons given below:

1. Recessive mutations that remained hidden in population for long time and may have suddenly expressed due to inbreeding or close breeding with exotic breeds.
2. Some goat breeds, for example Saneen, are more likely to develop hermaphrodite progeny phenotypes than other breeds.
3. Due to aged (old) goat stock kidding a newborn. The old age may accumulate mutations which can affect the gene for hermaphroditism.
4. Due to the nature of hermaphroditism recognized in goat breeds -- pseudohermaphrodite. This is a condition in which only external genitalia development is affected. This could also be caused by environmental factors that affect sex expression loci in goats.
