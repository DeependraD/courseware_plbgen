# Courseware for undergraduate curriculum in Plant Breeding and Genetics

This is a combination of course contents of 4 different subjects

1. Introductory Genetics
2. Introductory Plant Breeding
3. Genetics of Population
4. Introductory Biotechnology and Biodiversity

## Build instructions

- Each course file (Rmd or otherwise) should be built from its own current directory instead of project root, so that html links work properly and get compiled correctly in the first place.

## Issues

- html built of PLB221_introductory_plant_breeding is behaving inconsistently with firefox and chrome browser.
  - Solution: Try rendering as single repo online and diagnose.
