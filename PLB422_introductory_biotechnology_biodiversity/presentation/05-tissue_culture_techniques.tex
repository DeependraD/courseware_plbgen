\begin{frame}{Background}
\protect\hypertarget{background}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In vitro = axenic = sterile culture
\item
  Plant tissue culture is generally used for the aseptic culture of
  cells, tissues, organs, and their components under defined physical
  and chemical conditions in vitro.
\item
  First approach made by Henri-Louis Duhumel du Monceau in 1756
  (observed callus formation in plants)
\item
  Development of cell theory by Schleiden and Schwann during 1830s
\item
  Theoretical basis for plant tissue culture was proposed by Gottlieb
  Haberlandt in his address to the German Academy of Science in 1902 on
  his experiments on the culture of single cells.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History}
\protect\hypertarget{history}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first true plant tissue cultures were obtained by Gautheret (1934,
  1935) from cambial tissue of \emph{Acer pseudoplatanus}.
\item
  The first plant growth hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) was discovered
  in the mid-1930s by F. Kogl and his coworkers.
\item
  In 1934 Professor Philip White successfully cultured tomato roots.
\item
  In 1939 Gautheret successfully cultured carrot tissue.
\item
  Later in 1955 Carlos Miller and Folke Skoog published their discovery
  of the hormone kinetin, a cytokinin.
\item
  In 1962, Toshio Murashige and Skoog published the composition a plant
  tissue culture medium known as MS (named for the first letters of
  their last names) medium.
\item
  Murashige was a doctoral student in Professor Skoog's lab, and they
  developed the now-famous MS medium working with tobacco tissue
  cultures.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No single medium will support the growth of all cells.
\item
  Literature serves best to the purpose, else suitable medium is based
  on trial and error.
\item
  Medium contains in general, inorganic salts, and organic compounds
  like plant growth regulators, vitaims, a carbohydrate, hexitols, and a
  gelling agent.
\item
  Iron stably provided in chelated form with EDTA.
\item
  Medium can also include amino acids, antibiotics, or natural
  complexes.
\item
  Sometimes cultures are grown in the dark and do not photosynthesize at
  all.
\item
  Most media are adjusted to a pH of 5.2-5.8.
\item
  Solidification is done using agar derived from seaweed or agar
  substitutes such as \(Gelrite^{TM}\) or \(Phytagel^{TM}\).
\item
  WPM medium is suitable for culturing trees.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Inorganic salts}
\protect\hypertarget{inorganic-salts}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Murashige and Skoog (MS) (1962) formulation is the most widely
  used formulation.
\item
  The MS formulation was developed to insure that no increases in cell
  growth in vitro were due to the introduction of additional salts from
  plant tissue extracts which were being tested at that time.
\item
  The MS formulation insured that the inorganic nutrients were not
  limiting to tobacco cell growth and organic supplements such as yeast
  extract, coconut milk, casein hydrolysate, and plant extracts were no
  longer essential sources of the inorganic salts.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Inorganic salts}
\protect\hypertarget{inorganic-salts-1}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The distinguishing feature of the MS inorganic salts is their high
  content of nitrate, potassium, and ammonium in comparison to other
  salt formulations.
\item
  These salt stocks are prepared at 100 times the final medium
  concentration, and each stock is added at the rate of 10 ml per 1000
  ml of medium prepared. The NaFeEDTA stock should be protected from
  light by storing it in a bottle that is amber colored or wrapped in
  aluminum foil. Concentrated salt stocks enhance the accuracy and speed
  of media preparation.
\item
  Salt stocks are best stored in refrigerator and are stable for several
  months.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Type and concentration will vary according to the cell culture
  purpose. List is provided in Figure \ref{fig:pgr}.
\item
  Auxin (IAA, NAA, 2,4-D or IBA) is required by most plant cells for
  division and root initiation.
\item
  2,4-D is widely used for callus induction.
\item
  IAA, IBA and NAA are used for root induction.
\item
  Auxins can be dissolved either in alkali or in ethanol (latter is
  toxic to plants).
\item
  IAA stocks have a working duration of 1 weeks when kept away from
  light, they are thermostable, however.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PGRs}
\protect\hypertarget{pgrs-1}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cytokinins (kinetin, BA, zeatin and 2iP) promote cell division, shoot
  proliferation, and shoot morphogenesis.
\item
  Cytokinins are prepared in a fashion alike Auxins, except that 1 N HCL
  and a few drops of water are used to dissolve the crystals.
\item
  They can be stored for longer terms in the refrigerator and are
  thermostable.
\item
  Normally, gibberellin is infrequently used in plant cell culture due
  to callus growth and auxin induced adventitious root inhibition.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{PGRs}
\protect\hypertarget{pgrs-2}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Since stocks are highly susceptible to isomeric conversions, it should
  be made up fresh before addition to the medium by filter
  sterilization.
\item
  Abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone involved in leaf and fruit
  abscission and dormancy, is useful in embryo culture. Its stock
  solutions can be prepared in water. It is heat stable but light
  sensitive (conversion of cis to trans form in presence of light
  results in lesser biological activity).
\item
  Addition of ethylene biosynthetic inhibitors such as silver nitrate is
  beneficial.

\item
  Casein hydrolysate, an enzymatic digest of milk protein (caution: do
  not use the acid digest of milk proteins), was a common ingredient in

  to enhance tissue response.

\item
  \emph{Callus} is a wound tissue produced in response to injury. It is
  a proliferation of cells from the wounded or cut region of an explant.
  Callus is generally made up of friable, large, vacuolated cells that
  are highly differentiated, but are unorganized.
\item
  Callus can be hard and compact, and can contain regions of small
  meristematic cell clusters.
\item
  Generally meristematic, undifferentiated cells are competent to
  regenerate via somatic embryo or organ initiation.
