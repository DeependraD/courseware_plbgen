\item
  In vitro; a-xenic = sterile culture
\item
  Plant tissue culture is generally used for the aseptic culture of
  cells, tissues, organs, and their components under defined physical
  and chemical conditions \emph{in vitro}.
\item
  ``Tissue culture'' is commonly used as a collective term to describe
  all kinds of in vitro plant culture although strictly it should refer
  only to cultures of unorganized aggregates of cells.
\item
  First approach made by Henri-Louis Duhumel du Monceau in 1756
  (observed callus formation in plants)
\item
  Development of cell theory by Schleiden and Schwann during 1830s
\item
  Theoretical basis for plant tissue culture was proposed by Gottlieb
  Haberlandt in his address to the German Academy of Science in 1902 on
  his experiments on the culture of single cells.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History}
\protect\hypertarget{history}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first true plant tissue cultures were obtained by Gautheret (1934,
  1935) from cambial tissue of \emph{Acer pseudoplatanus} (large
  deciduous, temperate Maple tree).
\item
  The first plant growth hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) was discovered
  in the mid-1930s by F. Kogl and his coworkers.
\item
  In 1934 Professor Philip White successfully cultured tomato roots.
\item
  In 1939 Gautheret successfully cultured carrot tissue.
\item
  Later in 1955 Carlos Miller and Folke Skoog published their discovery
  of the hormone kinetin, a cytokinin.
\item
  In 1962, Toshio Murashige and Skoog published the composition a plant
  tissue culture medium known as MS (named for the first letters of
  their last names) medium.
\item
  Murashige was a doctoral student in Professor Skoog's lab, and they
  developed the now-famous MS medium working with tobacco tissue
  cultures.

  Dedifferentiation: The phenomenon of mature cells reverting to a
  meristematic state and forming undifferentiated callus tissues.
\item
  Redifferentiation: The ability of the component cells of the callus to
  differentiate into a whole plant or a plant organ is termed as
  redifferentiation.
\item
  Cellular totipotency: These two phenomena of dedifferentiation and
  redifferentiation are inherent in the capacity of a plant cell, and
  thus giving rise to a whole plant in known as cellular totipotency.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  No single medium will support the growth of all cells.
\item
  Literature serves best to the purpose, else suitable medium is based
  on trial and error.
\item
  Medium contains in general, inorganic salts, and organic compounds
  like plant growth regulators, vitaims, a carbohydrate, hexitols, and a
  gelling agent.
\item
  Iron stably provided in chelated form with EDTA.
\item
  Medium can also include amino acids, antibiotics, or natural
  complexes.
\item
  Sometimes cultures are grown in the dark and do not photosynthesize at
  all.
\item
  Most media are adjusted to a pH of 5.2-5.8.
\item
  Solidification is done using agar derived from seaweed or agar
  substitutes such as \(Gelrite^{TM}\) or \(Phytagel^{TM}\).
\item

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Inorganic salts}
\protect\hypertarget{inorganic-salts}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The Murashige and Skoog (MS) (1962) formulation is the most widely
  used formulation.
\item
  The MS formulation was developed to insure that no increases in cell
  growth in vitro were due to the introduction of additional salts from
  plant tissue extracts which were being tested at that time.
\item
  The MS formulation insured that the inorganic nutrients were not
  limiting to tobacco cell growth and organic supplements such as yeast
  extract, coconut milk, casein hydrolysate, and plant extracts were no
  longer essential sources of the inorganic salts.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-2}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The distinguishing feature of the MS inorganic salts is their high
  content of nitrate, potassium, and ammonium in comparison to other
  salt formulations.
\item
  These salt stocks are prepared at 100 times the final medium
  concentration, and each stock is added at the rate of 10 ml per 1000
  ml of medium prepared. The NaFeEDTA stock should be protected from
  light by storing it in a bottle that is amber colored or wrapped in
  aluminum foil. Concentrated salt stocks enhance the accuracy and speed
  of media preparation.
\item
  Salt stocks are best stored in refrigerator and are stable for several
  months.

\item
  Type and concentration will vary according to the cell culture
  purpose. List is provided in Figure \ref{fig:pgr}.
\item
  Auxin (IAA, NAA, 2,4-D or IBA) is required by most plant cells for
  division and root initiation.
\item
  2,4-D is widely used for callus induction.
\item
  IAA, IBA and NAA are used for root induction.
\item
  Auxins can be dissolved either in alkali or in ethanol (latter is
  toxic to plants).
\item
  IAA stocks have a working duration of 1 weeks when kept away from
  light, they are thermostable, however.

  proliferation, and shoot morphogenesis.
\item
  Cytokinins are prepared in a fashion alike Auxins, except that 1 N HCL
  and a few drops of water are used to dissolve the crystals.
\item
  They can be stored for longer terms in the refrigerator and are
  thermostable.
\item
  Normally, gibberellin is infrequently used in plant cell culture due
  to callus growth and auxin induced adventitious root inhibition.
\end{itemize}

\protect\hypertarget{section-6}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Since stocks are highly susceptible to isomeric conversions, it should
  be made up fresh before addition to the medium by filter
  sterilization.
\item
  Abscisic acid (ABA), a plant hormone involved in leaf and fruit
  abscission and dormancy, is useful in embryo culture. Its stock
  solutions can be prepared in water. It is heat stable but light
  sensitive (conversion of cis to trans form in presence of light
  results in lesser biological activity).
\item
  Addition of ethylene biosynthetic inhibitors such as silver nitrate is
  beneficial.

\item
  Culture of anthers or isolated micropsores to produce haploid plants
  is known as anther culture or microspore culture.
\item
  Embryos can be produced via a callus phase or be a direct
  recapitulation of the developmental stages characteristic of zygotic
  embryos.
\item
  late uninucleate to early binucleate microspores are the best explants
  for embryogenesis.
\item
  Somatic embryos develop into haploid plants.
\item
  Chromosome doubling can be further used to produce doubled haploids
  (homozygous).
\item
  In addition, haploid embryos are used in mutant isolation, gene
  transfer, studies of storage product biochemistry, and physiological
  aspects of embryo maturation.

\item
  Take young flower buds with immature anthers. Wash the buds. Surface
  sterilise and rinse with sterilise water.
\item
  Take one anther and crush in acetocarmine to test the stage of pollen.
  If found good, separate each anther from filament.
\item
  Discard immature, overmature and injured anthers.
\item
  Inoculate anthers horizontally on nutrient medium (liquid, solid).
\item
  In case of Brassica, microspore is used for dissecting the anthers. In
  case of cereals, spikes are harvested at uninucleate stage of
  microspore and then surface sterilise.
\item
  Place 10-20 anthers in a six cm petri dishes.
\item
  If anthers are cultured in liquid medium then 50 anthers can be
  cultured in 10 ml of liquid.
\item
  Shoots/plantlets (3-5 cm) transfer to another medium.

\item
  Squeeze out microspores in pressing them against the side of beaker
  with a glass rod.
\item
  Remove anther tissue debris by filtering through nylon sieve (pore
  size \(40\mu\) for tobacco and \(100\mu\) for maize)
\item
  Again filter the microspore suspension to obtain larger, good and
  viable microspore through nylon sieves.
\item
  Centrifuse the pollen suspension at low speed for 5 minutes.
\item
  Take pellet of pollen and resuspend in fresh medium and wash twice.
\item
  Culture on a medium at a density of \(10^3-10^4\) microspores/ml by
  pipetting.
\item
  Seal each etri dish containing microspores and medium with parafilm to
  avoid dehydration.
\item
  Incubate and observe.

The filterate is centrifuged at 1000 rev. per min for 3 minutes (D) and, after discarding the supernatant solution, the pellet is suspended in the B5-13 medium and gently loaded on the 24\%/32\%/40\% Percoll gradient solution (E) and centrifuged at 1000 rev. per min for 5 minutes. The two upper layers (F) are pipetted out and mixed with the B5-13 medium. The suspension is again centrifuged at 1000 rev. per min. for 5 minutes (G) and the supernatant medium is pipetted out and the pollen grains are suspended in NLN medium adjusting the plating density of the pollen grains to 2-5 x $10^4$ per mililiter. The suspension is plated as thin layer in petri plates (H) and incubated in the dark at 32 degree C for 3-5 days and then at 25 degree C. The regenerated tissue/embryos are transferred to 18 ml of hormone-free NLN medium in conical flasks (I) maintained on a shaking machine at 60 rev. per min at 32 degree C. Finally, the mature embryos are transferred to solidifed B5 medium containing 2\% sucrose for germination (J, K). Fertile plants can be obtained by diploidization of pollen plants (Okhawa, 1988). For a protocol on media composition and procedure refer to Page 223, Plant Tissue Culture: Theory and Practice, a Revised Edition by Bhojwani and Razdan (1996).}

\item
  Apical meristem tips is used (hence, aka. meristem culture, meristem
  tip culture, or shoot tip culture)
\item
  The apical meristem is usually a dome of tissue located at the extreme
  tip of a shoot and measures 0.1 mm in diameter and 0.25-0.3 mm in
  length. The apical meristem together with one or three young leaf
  primordial measuring 0.1-0.5 mm constitutes the shoot apex
\item
  Meristem culture in combination with thermotherapy has resulted in
  successful production of virus-free plants.
\item
  Culture involves the development of an already existing shoot apical
  meristem and the regeneration of adventitious roots.
\item
  Usually, 5-10 mm shoot apices containing the shoot meristem along with
  several leaf primordia are used.
