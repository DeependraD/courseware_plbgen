\section{DNA fragment separation using
Electrophoresis}\label{dna-fragment-separation-using-electrophoresis}}

\begin{frame}{Initial preparation}
\protect\hypertarget{initial-preparation}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Gel electrophoresis is used to separate DNA fragments by size
\item
  Gel consists of agarose, a polysaccharide extracted from seaweed that
  behaves like gelatin (commercial powder).
\item
  For visualizing DNA agarose gel is solidified, after subsequent
  cooling once the powder-water mixture is heated, into a rectangular
  slab about 1/4 inch thick by casting the molten liquid into a special
  tray.
\item
  To make small wells or holes at one end of the gel, comb is inserted
  before the gel hardens.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Process}
\protect\hypertarget{process}{}

Gel electrophoresis uses electric current to separate DNA molecules by
size. The agarose slab is immersed in a buffer-filled tank that has a
positive electrode at one end and a negative electrode at the other. DNA
samples are loaded into the wells, and when an electrical field is
applied, the DNA migrates through the gel. The phosphate backbone of DNA
is negatively charged, so it moves away from the negative electrode and
toward the positive electrode. Polymerized agarose acts as a sieve with
small holes between the tangled chains of agarose. The DNA must migrate
through these gaps. Agarose separates the DNA by size because larger
pieces of DNA are slowed down more by the agarose.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Visualization}
\protect\hypertarget{visualization}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The agarose gel is removed from the tank and immersed into a solution
  of ethidium bromide (mutagenic).
\item
  This dye intercalates between the bases of DNA or RNA, although less
  dye binds to RNA because it is single-stranded. When the gel is
  exposed to ultraviolet light, it fluoresces bright orange.
\item
  In Figure \ref{fig:gel-electrophoresis}, the DNA fragments are
  visualized by a positively charged dye from the thiazin family. The
  dye interacts with the negatively charged backbone of the DNA and is a
  nontoxic alternative that does not require ultraviolet light sources.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Notes}
\protect\hypertarget{notes}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Size of DNA being examined affects what type of gel is used.
\item
  Size of DNA molecules can be determined by comparing to a set of
  molecular weight standards run in a different well.
\item
  Because the standards are of known size, the experimental DNA fragment
  can be compared directly.
\item
  Resolvability of some gel matrix is different than other.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{}
\textrm{Fragments of DNA are separated by size using gel electrophoresis. A current causes the DNA fragments to move away from the negative electrode and toward the positive. As the DNA travels through agarose, the larger fragments get stuck in the gel pores more than the smaller DNA fragments. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis separates large pieces of DNA by alternating the electric current at right angles.}

\protect\hypertarget{dna-cutters-restriction-enzymes}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  DNA should be cut to fragments of different sizes because entire set
  of nuclear DNA is not of particular interest in visualization
\item
  Naturally occuring \emph{restriction enzymes} or \emph{restriction
  endonucleases} come into rescue in this operation.
\item
  These bacterial enzymes bind to specific recognition sites on DNA and
  cut the backbone of both strands.
\item
  These enzymes are methylation sensitive.
\item
  Bacteria produce \emph{modification enzymes} that recognize the same
  sequence as the corresponding restriction enzyme. These methylate each
  recognition site in the bacterial genome.
\end{itemize}

Since these ends may base pair with complementary sequences, they are considered 'sticky'.}\label{fig:restriction-enzymes}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DNA cutters: Restriction enzymes}
\protect\hypertarget{dna-cutters-restriction-enzymes-2}{}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Restriction enzymes have been exploited to cut DNA at specific sites,
  since each restriction enzyme has a particular recognition sequence.
  Difference in cleavage site determine the type of restriction enzyme.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Type I restriction enzymes cut the DNA strand 1000 or more base
    pairs from the recognition sequence.
  \item
    Type II restriction enzymes cut in the middle of the recognition
    sequence and are the most useful in genetic engineering. The Type II
    restriction enzymes can form \emph{both} sticky or \emph{blunt}
    ends.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The recognition sequences of Type II restriction enzymes are usually
  inverted repeats so that the enzymes cut between the same bases on the
  both strands.
\end{itemize}

\protect\hypertarget{dna-cutters-restriction-enzymes-4}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The number of base pairs in the recognition sequence determines the
  likelihood of cutting.
\item
  So to generate fewer, longer fragments, restriction enzymes with six
  or more base-pair recognition sequences are used.

\begin{frame}{DNA joiners: Ligase -- Overview}
\protect\hypertarget{dna-joiners-ligase-overview}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When two different DNA samples are cut with the same sticky-end
  restriction enzyme, all fragments will have identical overhangs.
\item
  This allows DNA fragments from two sources (e.g., two different
  organisms) to be linked together (Figure
  \ref{fig:restriction-ligation}).
\item
  Fragments are linked or ligated using DNA ligase
\item
  The efficiency of ligases depends on the total concentration of the
  substrates and also on the closeness of the ends to be ligated.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DNA joiners: Ligase -- Types}

\begin{frame}{Background}
\protect\hypertarget{background}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In 1969, Mary Lou Pardue and Joseph Gall developed a procedure by
  which they could hybridize radioactive single strands of DNA with
  complementary strands of DNA in chromosomes on glass slides.
\item
  This procedure, called in situ hybridization, Pardue and Gall were
  able to determine the chromosomal locations of repetitive DNA
  sequences.
\item
  Classical in situ hybridization involved spreading mitotic chromosomes
  on a glass slide, denaturing the DNA in the chromosomes by exposure to
  alkali (0.07 N NaOH) for a few minutes, rinsing with buffer to remove
  the alkaline solution, incubating the slide in hybridization solution
  containing radioactive copies of the nucleotide sequence of interest,
  washing off the radioactive strands that have not hybridized with
  complementary sequences in the chromosomes, exposing the slide to a
  photographic emulsion that is sensitive to low-energy radioactivity,
  developing the autoradiograph, and superimposing the autoradiograph on
  a photograph of the chromosomes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{FISH}
\protect\hypertarget{fish}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A repetitive DNA sequence can be identified as satellite DNA
  (generally non-transcribing) only if the sequence has a base
  composition sufficiently different from that of main-band DNA to
  produce a distinct band during density-gradient centrifugation.
  Therefore, centrifugation cannot be used to identify all repetitive
  DNA sequences.
\item
  Today, in situ hybridization experiments are often done by using
  hybridization probes that are linked to fluorescent dyes or antibodies
  tagged with fluorescent compounds \ref{fig:fish-hybridization1}.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{FISH}
\protect\hypertarget{fish-1}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In one protocol, DNA or RNA hybridization probes are linked to the
  vitamin biotin, which is bound with high affinity by the egg protein
  avidin \ref{fig:fish-hybridization1}.
\item
  By using avidin covalently linked to a fluorescent dye, the
  chromosomal location of the hybridized probe can be detected by the
  fluorescence of the dye.
\item
  This procedure, called FISH (Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization), has
  been used to demonstrate the presence of the repetitive sequence
  TTAGGG in the telomeres of human chromosomes
  \ref{fig:fish-hybridization2}.
\item
  The FISH procedure is very sensitive and can be used to detect the
  locations of single-copy sequences in human mitotic and interphase
  chromosomes.
