# Biodiversity

###

\begin{quote}
The extinction of species, each one a pilgrim of four billion years of evolution, is an irreversible loss. The ending of the lines of so many creatures with whom we have traveled this far is an occasion of profound sorrow and grief. Death can be accepted and to some degree transformed. But the loss of lineages and all their future young is not something to accept. It must be rigorously and intelligently resisted.
\end{quote}

### Meaning

- Refers to all the living things on Earth and the ecological processes associated with them. 
- Walter G. Rosen coined the term 'Biodiversity' (\alert{Biology} and \alert{Diversity}).
- Described in hierarchical terms including ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity. 
- Can be increased by natural evolutionary processes and genetic change or reduced by threats which lead to population decline and species extinction. 
- The capacity of an ecosystem to respond to changes and threats determines the rate of biodiversity loss.
- Biodiversity tends to cluster in hotspots.
- Current species inhabitation of earth is estimated at 10-14 million.
- Mass composition of biosphere is estimated at 4 Trillion mt of Carbon.
- The term 'biodiversity' emerged in the 1980s as a result of the changing understanding of the role of diversity in natural processes.

<!-- When a strongly channeled outflow cools down to 40 degree C or below, the diversity goes up rapidly. Metazoan animals can adapt to live directly in the warm water, and eucaryotic algae such as green algae and diatoms invade. Although cyanobacteria are still abundant, they are heavily grazed, and do not form a thick mat. In different expressions of this community are found crustacea, midges (Diptera), and water mites (Hydrachnellae), dominated by a top predator, the larva of the dragonfly, Erythemis collocatta. The net effect on diversity is to increase the species numbers to 50 to 60, exclusive of the nonphotosynthetic microorganisms. -->

### Definition

\begin{block}{Diversity}
The existence of a wide variety of species (species diversity), other taxa of plants or other organisms in a natural environment or habitat, or communities within a particular environment (ecological diversity), or of genetic variation within a species (genetic diversity).
\end{block}

###

\begin{block}{Biodiversity defined under CBD Article 2(1)}
the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Agrobiodiversity}
The variety and variability of animals, plants, and microorganisms used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture (crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries). it comprises the diversity of genetic resources (varieties, breeds, etc.) and species used for food, fuel, fodder, fiber, and pharmaceuticals.
\end{block}

<!-- Refer to Chapter 6 (Plant biodiversity), Plant Biology and Biotechnology, Volume 1, 2015. -->

```

### Distribution

- Generally, diversity is more in warmer and wetter climates than in cooler and drier ones (McNeely et al., 1990). Seventy per cent of the world’s biodiversity is found in only 12 "mega-diverse" countries -- Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Zaire, Madagascar, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Mexico – which, with the exception of Australia, are all developing, non-Western nations.

- South africa contains the most biological diversity in plant species. [Wilson, 1992, p. 260]

- Mainly conditioned by
  - temperature, 
  - precipitation, 
  - altitude, 
  - soils,
  - geography and 
  - presence of other species

## Importance

### General values

- Species have utilitarian (subsistence and commercial) value to human,
- Biodiversity represents the natural balance within an ecosystem that provides a number of ecological services, including nutrient cycling and pollination of plants, and 
- Species have intrinsic value; value of life
- Linked to daily livelihood and economic wellbeing of Nepalese
- Specifically,
  - Genetic diversity provides resources for genetic resistance to pests and diseases; 
  - In agriculture, biodiversity is a production system characterized by the presence of multiple plant and/or animal species

### Ecosystem services: beneficial consequences of biodiversity

- Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water). Greater species diversity 
  - increases fodder yield
  - increases overall crop yield
  - increases overall wood production, in trees
- Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control). Greater species diversity
  - of fish increases the stability of fisheries yield
  - of natural pest enemies decreases herbivorous pest populations
  - of plants decreases disease prevalence on plants
  - of plants increases resistance to plant invasion
  - of plants increases carbon sequestration, but note that this finding only relates to actual uptake of carbon dioxide and not long term storage
  - plants increases soil nutrient remineralization

knitr::include_graphics("../images/primary_secondary_tertiary_gene_pools_coffee.png")

# Polyploidy is certainly involved in the origin of C. arabica (2n = 44), since 2n equals 22 in all other species. Since more than 40 traits thus far investigated all show disomic inheritance and only occassional bivalents are formed in meiosis of haploids (dihaploids), autopolyploidization of a diploid species is very unlikely. C. arabica can probably be properly considered a segmental allopolyploid in the sense defined by Stebbins (1950), as several authors have suggested.

# Aim

### Identification and characterization

<!-- Classifying and naming organisms is probably as old as human language. Linnean binomial nomenclature laid the foundations of taxonomy, i.e. naming species scientifically, and evolved into Codes defining rules for scientific naming of animals, plants, bacteria and viruses. Additional frameworks and databases were established to deal with genetic variability, as observed in cultivars, animal races, genetic sequences and transgenic organisms. Only 1.75 million extant species have hitherto been named scientifically. Classification of biodiversity is hierarchical.-->

\bcolumns
\column{0.65\textwidth}
\small

- Biodiversity is characterized by classification and naming of its elements -- genes, species and ecosystems.
- Both cultural expressions as well as scientific endeavours such as genetic sequencing may be used in the approach.
- Classification of biodiversity is **hierarchical**.
- Modern **systematics** tries to reflect the "natural" system, based on the relation and genealogy of species as "products" of evolution, based on Darwin´s theory and its extensions through the "modern synthesis" -- visualized as a "tree of life".
<!-- The exact relation between its branches is still a matter of research and discussion. -->
- Major issues with systematics:
  - Basis of grouping (morphology, form, DNA sequences, etc.)
  - Definition of "species"

\column{0.35\textwidth}

<!-- Characterization of biodiversity is not only a scientific exercise, but a fundamental trait of humans, deeply rooted within all cultures. It might be motivated by ecological or economic dependence, religious or aesthetic empathy (Wilson 1984), or, to put it more simply, curiosity, fascination or pastime. The very early representations are restricted to wildlife, and therefore clearly represent a hunter´s background. Cultural artefacts were made from animal products, such as bones or ivory. Among the earliest cultural artifacts are astoundingly accurate representations of wildlife in caves. Research combining archaeology and zoological analysis of cave paintings revealed that these were accurate documentations of the extant fauna and must be considered as early documents in the chain of evidence for ecological change in recent times. -->

<!-- For example, hunters and fishermen have their own arcane terminology, and breeders characterize thousands of races, sports or varieties. Plant breeders require exact knowledge of cultivars, including the taxonomy and genomics of their wild relatives. Hunting, fishery and logging needs data on stocks of reliably identified species. Agriculturists must identify pest species, potential invaders and their natural enemies. In summary, all these applied fields need solid, fundamental data from biodiversity research. -->

  \item a more thorough incorporation of natural processes;
  \item reduced use of off-farm inputs, with less harm to the environment and consumers;
  \item a more productive use of biological and genetic potentials of plant and animals;
  \item a better match between cropping patterns and the physical capacity of lands; and
  \item an improved emphasis on conservation of soil, water, energy and biological resources.
