# Concept

## Biodiversity

###

\begin{quote}
The extinction of species, each one a pilgrim of four billion years of evolution, is an irreversible loss. The ending of the lines of so many creatures with whom we have traveled this far is an occasion of profound sorrow and grief. Death can be accepted and to some degree transformed. But the loss of lineages and all their future young is not something to accept. It must be rigorously and intelligently resisted.
\end{quote}
\begin{flushright} --Gary Snyder (1990) \end{flushright}

### Meaning

- Refers to all the living things on Earth and the ecological processes associated with them. 
- Mixture of \alert{Biology} and \alert{Diversity}
- Walter G. Rosen coined the term 'Biodiversity'.
- Described in hierarchical terms including ecosystem diversity, species diversity, and genetic diversity. 
- Can be increased by natural evolutionary processes and genetic change or reduced by threats which lead to population decline and species extinction. 
- The capacity of an ecosystem to respond to changes and threats determines the rate of biodiversity loss.
- Biodiversity tends to cluster in hotspots.
- Current species inhabitation of earth is estimated at 10-14 million.
- Mass composition of biosphere is estimated at 4 Trillion mt of Carbon.
- The term 'biodiversity' emerged in the 1980s as a result of the changing understanding of the role of diversity in natural processes.

### Definition

\begin{block}{Diversity}
The existence of a wide variety of species (species diversity), other taxa of plants or other organisms in a natural environment or habitat, or communities within a particular environment (ecological diversity), or of genetic variation within a species (genetic diversity).
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Biodiversity defined under CBD Article 2(1)}
the variability among living organisms from all sources including, inter alia, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Agrobiodiversity}
The variety and variability of animals, plants, and microorganisms used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture (crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries). it comprises the diversity of genetic resources (varieties, breeds, etc.) and species used for food, fuel, fodder, fiber, and pharmaceuticals.
\end{block}

knitr::include_graphics("./../images/oryza_distribution_chromosome.png")
```

### Distribution

- Generally, diversity is more in warmer and wetter climates than in cooler and drier ones (McNeely et al., 1990). Seventy per cent of the world’s biodiversity is found in only 12 "mega-diverse" countries -- Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Zaire, Madagascar, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and Mexico – which, with the exception of Australia, are all developing, non-Western nations.

- South africa contains the most biological diversity in plant species. [Wilson, 1992, p. 260]

- Mainly conditioned by
  - temperature, 
  - precipitation, 
  - altitude, 
  - soils,
  - geography and 
  - presence of other species

## Importance

### General values

- Species have utilitarian (subsistence and commercial) value to human,
- Biodiversity represents the natural balance within an ecosystem that provides a number of ecological services, including nutrient cycling and pollination of plants, and 
- Species have intrinsic value; value of life
- Linked to daily livelihood and economic wellbeing of Nepalese
- Specifically,
  - Genetic diversity provides resources for genetic resistance to pests and diseases; 
  - In agriculture, biodiversity is a production system characterized by the presence of multiple plant and/or animal species

### Ecosystem services: beneficial consequences of biodiversity

- Provisioning services which involve the production of renewable resources (e.g.: food, wood, fresh water). Greater species diversity 
  - increases fodder yield
  - increases overall crop yield
  - increases overall wood production, in trees
- Regulating services which are those that lessen environmental change (e.g.: climate regulation, pest/disease control). Greater species diversity
  - of fish increases the stability of fisheries yield
  - of natural pest enemies decreases herbivorous pest populations
  - of plants decreases disease prevalence on plants
  - of plants increases resistance to plant invasion
  - of plants increases carbon sequestration, but note that this finding only relates to actual uptake of carbon dioxide and not long term storage
  - plants increases soil nutrient remineralization

### Nonmaterial services

- Cultural services represent human value and enjoyment (e.g.: landscape aesthetics, cultural heritage, outdoor recreation and spiritual significance
- Betterment of knowledge systems
- Educational value

- Five major **physiographic** landscapes extending from east to west, namely 
  - High Himal, 
  - High Mountains, 
  - Middle Mountains, 
  - Siwaliks and 
  - Tarai

- Forests (with shrubland): 39.6%
- Grasslands and pastures: 12%

### National

- A total of 118 ecosystems
- Forest ecosystems can be categorized into ten major groups, namely 
  - tropical, 
  - subtropical broadleaved, 
  - subtropical conifer, 
  - lower temperate broadleaved,

  - upper temperate broadleaved, 
  - upper temperate mixed broadleaved,
  - temperate coniferous, 
  - subalpine, and

### National

- Wetlands characterized by high diversity. Nine of the country’s wetlands have been listed as Ramsar sites. 
- 12 of the 867 global terrestrial ecoregions.
- Occupies about 0.1% of the global area, but harbors 3.2% and 1.1% of the world’s known flora and fauna, respectively. 
- This includes 5.2% of the world's known mammals, 9.5% birds, 5.1% gymnosperms, and 8.2% bryophytes.
- The country is also rich in diversity of agricultural crops, their wild relatives, and domestic animal species and varieties. 

### National

- Over 550 crop species identified as having food value, and around half of those species are believed to be currently under cultivation. 
- Horticultural diversity includes:
  - ~ 400 species and subspecies of crops 
  - 45 species of seasonal fruits, 200 species of vegetables, including 11 local varieties of potatoes 
- Diversity of domestic animals.

  - 284 flowering plants, 
  - 160 species of animals (including one species of mammal), 
  - 1 species of bird, 
  - 14 species of herpeto-fauna 
- The high altitude rangelands are especially important from the perspective of endemism.
