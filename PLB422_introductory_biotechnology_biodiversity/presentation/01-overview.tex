\begin{block}{The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s classical interpretation}
Agricultural biotechnology is a collection of scientific techniques, including genetic engineering, that are used to create, improve, or modify plants, animals, and microorganisms...
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the in-house research agency of
  USDA, classifies biotechnology research into six components:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    basic engineering of recombinant DNA;
  \item
    DNA sequencing;
  \item
    genomic mapping with molecular markers;
  \item
    monoclonal antibodies;
  \item
    cell fusion and chromosome transfer;
  \item
    biologically-based processing
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classical plant breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{classical-plant-breeding}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Practicing classical plant breeding means many thousands of plants
  must be cross-pollinated to find the one offspring with higher yield.
\item
  In crossing plants,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Pollen must be taken from one plant and manually placed on another.
  \item
    The possibility of finding improved traits is limited by the amount
    of genetic diversity already present in the plants.
  \item
    Consequently, if the two plants that are crossed share many of the
    same genes, the amount of possible improvement is limited.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Therefore, scientists have searched for better ways to improve plants.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mutation breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{mutation-breeding}{}
\bcolumns
\column{0.6\textwidth}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the 1920s, scientists realized that \emph{mutations} could be
  induced in seeds by using chemical mutagens or by exposure to X-rays
  or gamma rays.
\item
  Outcome of such treatments is even less predictable than traditional
  breeding methods.
\item
  Successful in world of flowers; new colors and more petals have been
  expressed in flowers such as tulips, snapdragons, roses,
  chrysanthemums, and many others.
\item
  Mutation breeding has also been tried on vegetables, fruits, and
  crops. For instance, peppermint plants that are resistant to fungus
  were generated this way.

\begin{frame}{Transgenic technology vs traditional breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{transgenic-technology-vs-traditional-breeding}{}
\small

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A plant can be transformed with a gene from any source, including
  animals, bacteria, or viruses as well as other plants, whereas
  traditional cross-breeding methods move genes only between members of
  a particular genus of plants.
\item
  Furthermore, transgenes can be placed in precise locations within the
  genome and have known functions that have been evaluated extensively
  before being inserted into the plant.
\item
  In traditional breeding, on the other hand, the identity of genes
  responsible for improving the crop is rarely known.
\item
  Introduction of molecular breeding -- more predictable way to enhance
  crops.
\item
  Movement of genes from foreign sources into a specific plant,
  resulting in a \emph{transgenic} plant.
\item
  The foreign gene, or transgene, may confer specific resistance to an
  insect, protect the plant against a specific herbicide, or enhance the
  vitamin content of the crop.
\item
  With something so powerful as genetic engineering, one mistake could
  have profound and wide-ranging effects. We must impose tough controls
  on the genetics supply industry and work to make sure that the new
  techniques are in the service of the global community

\item
  Decomposition of foodstuffs generally accompanied by the evolution of
  gas.
\item
  The best-known example is alcoholic fermentation, in which sugar is
  converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.
\item
  This conversion, described by the equation below, was established by
  J. L. Gay-Lussac in 1815.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{History}
\protect\hypertarget{history-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Before 1800 the association of yeast or leaven with fermentation had
  been noted, but the nature of these agents was not understood.
\item
  Experiments of C. Cagniard-Latour, of F. T. Kutzing, and of T Schwann
  in 1837 indicated that yeast is a living organism and is the cause of
  fermentation.
\item
  This view was opposed by such leading chemists as J. von Liebig and F.
  Wohler, who sought a chemical rather than a biological explanation of
  the process.
\item
  The biological concept became generally accepted following the work of
  Louis Pasteur, who concluded that fermentation is a physiological
  counterpart of oxidation, and permits organisms to live and grow in
  the absence of air (anaerobically).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History}
\protect\hypertarget{history-2}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This linked fermentation and putrefaction as comparable processes;
  both represent decompositions of organic matter brought about by
  microorganisms in the absence of air.
\item
  The difference is determined by the nature of the decomposable
  material;

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    sugary substances generally yield products with pleasant odor and
    taste (fermentation),
  \item
    proteins give rise to evil-smelling products (putrefaction).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Pasteur also discovered the lactic acid and butyric acid
  fermentations, and from his experiments concluded that each kind of
  fermentation was caused by a specific microbe.
\item
  Later work supported this idea to a large extent, and considerably
  increased the number of specific fermentations.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Process}
\protect\hypertarget{process}{}
During fermentation organic matter is decomposed in the absence of air
(oxygen); hence, there is always an accumulation of reduction products,
or incomplete oxidation products. Some of these products (for example,
alcohol and lactic acid) are of importance to society, and fermentation
has therefore been used for their manufacture on an industrial scale.
With regard to historic roots of the process, Converting dry grains and
other seeds into something more appetizing than a gruel must have made
agriculture more attractive and valuable. Alcohol, despite its dangers,
provided (and still provides), in reasonable moderation, a basis for
social interaction. There are also many microbiological processes that
go on in the presence of air while yielding incomplete oxidation
products. Good examples are the formation of acetic acid (vinegar) from
alcohol by vinegar bacteria, and of citric acid from ugar by certain
molds (for example, \emph{Aspergillus niger}). These microbial
processes, too, have gained industrial importance, and are often
referred to as fermentations, even though they do not conform to
Pasteur's concept of fermentation as a decomposition in the absence of
air.

\begin{frame}{DNA fingerprinting}
\protect\hypertarget{dna-fingerprinting}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  DNA fingerprinting relies on the unique pattern made by a series of
  DNA fragments after separating them according to length by gel
  electrophoresis.
\item
  The samples are then processed to generate a set of DNA fragments.
  When Alec Jeffreys invented DNA fingerprinting in 1985 in England, the
  DNA was cut with restriction enzymes to generate fragments because PCR
  had not yet been invented.
\item
  Nowadays, DNA is prepared by PCR, and fluorescent dyes are used for
  labeling. In addition, modern DNA fingerprinting uses repeated
  sequences (short tandem repeats or STRs) for routine identification
  purposes.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DNA fingerprinting}
\protect\hypertarget{dna-fingerprinting-1}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For the first generation of DNA fingerprints, restriction enzymes were
  used to generate the variation in DNA fragment size between
  individuals. Variations in the DNA base sequence of restriction enzyme
  recognition sites result in differences in the size of the fragments.
\item
  Such sequence differences are called restriction fragment length
  polymorphisms (\textbf{RFLPs}).
\item
  Many different restriction enzymes with distinct recognition sites are
  used on each DNA sample.
\item
  Even if mutations have changed a few bases of the target sequence
  around the cut site, there is usually still enough similarity for
  probes to bind.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{RFLP steps}
\protect\hypertarget{rflp-steps}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The DNA is cut with a restriction enzyme.
\item
  The DNA fragments are separated by length or molecular weight by gel
  electrophoresis.
\item
  The fragments are visualized by Southern blotting. The separated
  fragments are transferred from the gel to nylon paper. Then a
  radioactively labeled DNA probe is added.
\item
  The probe binds to those DNA fragments with complementary sequences.
\item
  The blot is covered with radiation-sensitive film to give an
  autoradiograph. This shows the location of those DNA fragments that
  reacted with the radioactive probe.
\item
  The final product of a DNA fingerprint is an autoradiograph that
  contains at least five essential lanes (Figure
  \ref{fig:fingerprint-lanes}). The markers are standardized DNA
  fragments of known size, which have been radioactively labeled.
