\begin{frame}{Overview}
\protect\hypertarget{overview}{}

\begin{block}{The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s classical interpretation}
Agricultural biotechnology is a collection of scientific techniques, including genetic engineering, that are used to create, improve, or modify plants, animals, and microorganisms...
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the in-house research agency of
  USDA, classifies biotechnology research into six components:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    basic engineering of recombinant DNA;
  \item
    DNA sequencing;
  \item
    genomic mapping with molecular markers;
  \item
    monoclonal antibodies;
  \item
    cell fusion and chromosome transfer;
  \item
    biologically-based processing
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Overview}
\protect\hypertarget{overview-1}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Humans have continually improved crop plants and animals by selective
  breeding, mostly by trial and error.
\item
  However, the field of genetics is quickly transitting into a highly
  advanced scientic practice, wherein there is now not much place for
  trial and error studies.
\item
  The modern biotechnology of interest centers upon the newfound ability
  to remove DNA from cells of an organism, modify it, and reinsert it
  into cells where it will be functional.
\item
  This process is sometimes called ``genetic engineering,'' and products
  therefrom have often been ingenuously termed ``genetically modified
  organisms'' (GMOs), even though all crop plants are genetically
  modified in one way or another.
\item
  The traditional breeder's available gene pool is predominantly limited
  to those genes in sexually-compatible organisms, whereas modern
  biotechnology enables some new, wider-ranging, choices.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Classical plant breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{classical-plant-breeding}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Practicing classical plant breeding means many thousands of plants
  must be cross-pollinated to find the one offspring with higher yield.
\item
  In crossing plants,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Pollen must be taken from one plant and manually placed on another.
  \item
    The possibility of finding improved traits is limited by the amount
    of genetic diversity already present in the plants.
  \item
    Consequently, if the two plants that are crossed share many of the
    same genes, the amount of possible improvement is limited.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Therefore, scientists have searched for better ways to improve plants.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Mutation breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{mutation-breeding}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the 1920s, scientists realized that \emph{mutations} could be
  induced in seeds by using chemical mutagens or by exposure to X-rays
  or gamma rays.
\item
  Outcome of such treatments is even less predictable than traditional
  breeding methods.
\item
  Successful in world of flowers; new colors and more petals have been
  expressed in flowers such as tulips, snapdragons, roses,
  chrysanthemums, and many others.
\item
  Mutation breeding has also been tried on vegetables, fruits, and
  crops. For instance, peppermint plants that are resistant to fungus
  were generated this way.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Modern breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{modern-breeding}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Introduction of molecular breeding-- more predictable way to enhance
  crops.
\item
  Movement of genes from foreign sources into a specific plant,
  resulting in a \emph{transgenic} plant.
\item
  The foreign gene, or transgene, may confer specific resistance to an
  insect, protect the plant against a specific herbicide, or enhance the
  vitamin content of the crop.
\item
  With something so powerful as genetic engineering, one mistake could
  have profound and wide-ranging effects. We must impose tough controls
  on the genetics supply industry and work to make sure that the new
  techniques are in the service of the global community
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\hypertarget{history}{%
\section{History}\label{history}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The science of genetics was transformed by the discovery of DNA
  (deoxyribonucleic acid)
\item
  Francis Crick and James Watson along with Rosalind Franklin, in 1953,
  discovered that the DNA structure was a double helix: two strands
  twisted around each other like a spiral staircase with bars across
  like rings
\item
  The structure, function, and composition of DNA are virtually
  identical in all living organisms---from a blade of grass to an
  elephant
\item
  Difference only in precise ordering of chemical base that make up DNA
\item
  This formed idea that changing this ordering will lead to modification
  of lifeforms
\item
  Marshall Nirenberg and H. Gobind Khorana carried out the deciphering
  of the genetic code in 1961
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{History}
\protect\hypertarget{history-1}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  While some were seeking to alter the genetic make-up of living things
  by transferring specific genes from one organism to another, they now
  had tools to alter exactly the hereditary material at the molecular
  level.
\item
  Walter Gilbert carried out the first recombinant DNA experiments in
  1973
\item
  First hybridomas created in 1975
\item
  The production of monoclonal antibodies for diagnostics was carried
  out in 1982,
\item
  The first recombinant human therapeutic protein, insulin (humulin),
  was produced in 1982.
\item
  In 1976, the U.S. company Genentech became the first biotech company
  to develop technologies to rearrange DNA.
\item
  1980 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court allowed genetically-engineered
  microorganisms to be patented. This means that virtually any lifeform
  on this planet can theoretically become the private property of the
  company or person who ``creates'' it.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History}
\protect\hypertarget{history-2}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Clues to understanding fermentation emerged in the seventeenth century
  when Dutch experimentalist Anton Van Leeuwenhoek discovered
  microorganisms using his microscope.
\item
  He unraveled the chemical basis of the process of fermentation using
  analytical techniques for the estimation of carbon dioxide.
\item
  Two centuries later, in 1857, a French scientist Louis Pasteur
  published his first report on lactic acid formation from sugar by
  fermentation. He proved that fermentation is the consequence of
  anaerobic life and identified three of its types:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Fermentation, which generates gas;
  \item
    Fermentation that results in alcohol; and
  \item
    Fermentation, which results in acids.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History}
\protect\hypertarget{history-3}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  At the end of the nineteenth century, Eduard Buchner observed the
  formation of ethanol and carbon dioxide when cell-free extract of
  yeast was added to an aqueous solution of sugars. Thus, he proved that
  cells are not essential for the fermentation process and the
  components responsible for the process are dissolved in the extract.
  He named that substance ``Zymase''.
\item
  During World war I,

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Germany produced glycerine for making the explosive nitroglycerine
  \item
    Bacteria that converts corn or molasses into acetone for making the
    explosive cordite.
  \item
    Sir Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin, the first
    antibiotic, proved highly successful in treating wounded soldiers.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transgenic technology vs traditional breeding}
\protect\hypertarget{transgenic-technology-vs-traditional-breeding}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A plant can be transformed with a gene from any source, including
  animals, bacteria, or viruses as well as other plants, whereas
  traditional cross-breeding methods move genes only between members of
  a particular genus of plants.
\item
  Furthermore, transgenes can be placed in precise locations within the
  genome and have known functions that have been evaluated extensively
  before being inserted into the plant.
\item
  In traditional breeding, on the other hand, the identity of genes
  responsible for improving the crop is rarely known.

\item
  The best-known example is alcoholic fermentation, in which sugar is
  converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.
\item
  This conversion, described by the equation below, was established by
  J. L. Gay-Lussac in 1815.

\begin{frame}{History}
\protect\hypertarget{history-4}{}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Before 1800 the association of yeast or leaven with fermentation had
  been noted, but the nature of these agents was not understood.
\item
  Experiments of C. Cagniard-Latour, of F. T. Kutzing, and of T Schwann
  in 1837 indicated that yeast is a living organism and is the cause of
  fermentation.
\item
  This view was opposed by such leading chemists as J. von Liebig and F.
  Wohler, who sought a chemical rather than a biological explanation of
  the process.
\item
  The biological concept became generally accepted following the work of
  Louis Pasteur, who concluded that fermentation is a physiological
  counterpart of oxidation, and permits organisms to live and grow in
  the absence of air (anaerobically).

\item
  This linked fermentation and putrefaction as comparable processes;
  both represent decompositions of organic matter brought about by
  microorganisms in the absence of air.
\item
  The difference is determined by the nature of the decomposable
  material;

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    sugary substances generally yield products with pleasant odor and
    taste (fermentation),
  \item
    proteins give rise to evil-smelling products (putrefaction).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Pasteur also discovered the lactic acid and butyric acid
  fermentations, and from his experiments concluded that each kind of
  fermentation was caused by a specific microbe.
\item
  Later work supported this idea to a large extent, and considerably
  increased the number of specific fermentations.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Process}
\protect\hypertarget{process}{}

During fermentation organic matter is decomposed in the absence of air
(oxygen); hence, there is always an accumulation of reduction products,
or incomplete oxidation products. Some of these products (for example,
alcohol and lactic acid) are of importance to society, and fermentation
has therefore been used for their manufacture on an industrial scale.
With regard to historic roots of the process, Converting dry grains and
other seeds into something more appetizing than a gruel must have made
agriculture more attractive and valuable. Alcohol, despite its dangers,
provided (and still provides), in reasonable moderation, a basis for
social interaction. There are also many microbiological processes that
go on in the presence of air while yielding incomplete oxidation
products. Good examples are the formation of acetic acid (vinegar) from
alcohol by vinegar bacteria, and of citric acid from ugar by certain
molds (for example, \emph{Aspergillus niger}). These microbial
processes, too, have gained industrial importance, and are often
referred to as fermentations, even though they do not conform to
Pasteur's concept of fermentation as a decomposition in the absence of
air.
