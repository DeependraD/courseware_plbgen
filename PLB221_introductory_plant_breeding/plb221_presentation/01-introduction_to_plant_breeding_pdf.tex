more and better wheat for feeding the hungry world, but wheat is merely
a catalyst, a part of the picture. I am interested in the total

\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
"Breeder's eye" viewpoint of Plant Breeding: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Plant breeding is an applied science and an art 
\item Early plant breeders depended primarily on intuition, skill, and judgement in their work.
\item Plant breeding was practiced first when people learned to look for superior plants to harvest for seed; thus selection became the earliest method of plant breeding. However few people may have had conscious efforts in so-doing.
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}  %%<--- here
Scientific viewpoint of Plant Breeding: 
\begin{itemize}
\item "Breeding" is about a more active process of crossing different strains of plant for particular results.
\item Plant evolution directed by man (N.I. Vavilov)
\item Process of generating and utilizing variability
\item "Selection" is about picking the best from each generation
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-5}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  As human knowledge about plants increased, people were able to select
  more intelligently.
\item
  With the discovery of sex in plants, hybridization was added to
  breeding techniques.
\item
  Although hybridization was practiced before the time of Mendel, its
  significance in inheritance was not clearly understood.
\item
  Mendel's experiments provided a basis for understanding the mechanism
  of heredity and how it may be manipulated in the development of
  improved varieties.
\item
  A more precise explanation of the heredity mechanism has become
  possible in recent years with advances in biochemical genetics.
\item
  Now, plant breeding is more about making precise crossess and accurate
  prediction

\item
  Plant breeding is essentially an election made by man of the best
  plants within a variable population as a potential cultivar.

\begin{frame}{History (Overview)}
\protect\hypertarget{history-overview}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Broadly, two distinct stages in plant breeding could be characterized

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Domestication of the first crops to the birth of Mendelian genetics
  \item
    Acceptance of Medelian genetics to post-mendel era
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The work of Gregor Mendel and further advances in science that
  followed his discoveries established that plant traits are controlled
  by hereditary factors or genes that consist of DNA (deoxyribose
  nucleic acid, the hereditary material).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{History (Pre-mendel era)}
\protect\hypertarget{history-pre-mendel-era}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Plant breeding started with sedentary agriculture and the
  domestication of the first agricultural plants, the cereals, which
  were chosen by early man.
\item
  A family of French seed growers, the Vilmorins, established in 1727
  the first company devoted to plant breeding and the production of new
  varieties.
\item
  The sexuality of plants was described by Caesalpinus in 1583 and in
  1696 Camerarius published an essay entitled `De sexo plantarum', but
  it was Kolreuter, a German botanist who was the first to exploit this
  knowledge in the production of the first artificial plant hybrids in
  Nicotiana.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\note{
Sedentary agriculture and domestication led to the rapid elimination of undesirable characters such as seed shattering and dormancy. It seems natural that the need to collect fruits, seeds and roots for nutrition brought with it the knowledge to identify plants, aspects of their biology and their potential as food, poison or other uses. The need for pollination for fruit setting in dates was recognized some nine centuries before Christ, as can be deduced from the observation of an Asyrian bas-relief showing the pollination of female date palms with male pollen. Until the first decenium of this century plant breeding was in the hands of 'experts' who in many cases were unable to make progress due to a lack of knowledge of the fundamental plant processes such as the reproductive system. In spite of this, however, some important goals were reached before the rediscovery of Mendel's laws and the consecration of genetics as a science. Some examples are worth mentioning. In France, in the 17th century, several varieties of 'heading lettuce' were developed, some of which are still in cultivation.
}

\note{ 
A family of French seed growers, the Vilmorins, established in 1727 the first company devoted to plant breeding and the production of new varieties. A member of the family, Louis de Vilmorin, was the first, some years later, to use the progeny test, evaluating a selection by the study of its descendants.
}

\note{
A well-known example of premendelian plant breeding is that of sugar beet. In 1747 Margraaf discovered that the roots of the forage beet contained about 6\% of sucrose. By the beginning of the 19th century, Achard, by means of mass selection, increased this to 11\%. Application of the Vilmorin pedigree method had further increased this to 16\% by 1810.
}

\note{
The use of artificial crosses in premendelian breeding can be exemplified by the case of Fragaria x ananassa developed in the botanical garden of Paris by Duchesne, in the 17th century by crossing F. chiloense with F. virginiana. In England at about the same time new varieties of fruits, wheat and peas were being obtained by artificial hybridization.

\begin{frame}{History (Post-mendel era)}
\protect\hypertarget{history-post-mendel-era}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  After the rediscovery of the work of Mendel in 1900 it was some six
  years before Bateson, who coined the name `genetics' for the new
  science, realized that this new discipline could give a scientific
  basis and new openings to plant breeding methods.
\item
  Genetics has given to breeding a better knowledge of the processes
  involved in the mechanisms of variability and the necessary
  information for regulating and increasing such variability.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\note{
Modern plant breeding is, as has already been stated, applied genetics, but its scientific basis is broader and uses, as conceptual and technical tools, cytology, systematics, physiology, pathology, entomology, chemistry and statistics and has also developed its own technology. There have been many advances in these various areas which have made a substantial contribution to plant breeding. These include the demonstration of the auto- and allopolyploid nature of many crop plants and their origin. This opened the way to the production of artificial polyploid forms and their direct or indirect exploitation. The discovery of the possibility of increasing the frequency of mutations by means of radiation or chemicals was hailed as a means of increasing the variability available to the breeder. There have been many other developments which have all contributed to the progress and success of plant breeding too numerous to exemplify in detail but include such areas as quantitative inheritance and genotype x environment interaction, resistance breeding, and the conservation and characterization of genetic resources.
}

\note{
More recent genetical advances than those outlined earlier have allowed breeders to design new methods as is well exemplified by the developments in such areas as RFLP mapping and marker-assisted selection, gene cloning and genetic transformation. The ceilings for yield that some authorities claim have been reached will be surpassed by the combined application of the classical and the new methods available to the breeder. Where yield as such is not the prime criterion of a breeding programme they will allow the production of more efficient cultivars which can maintain production without the requirement for expensive inputs. At the same time breeding can and will make a positive contribution to halting the decline in the agricultural environment.

``Charles Darwin's writing in the nineteenth century first formulated
the idea of evolution, the idea that plants and animals are in constant
competition, which results in the fittest or the best adapted surviving
and passing on their genes to the next generation, those less
well-adapted dying or failing to reproduce and so not passing on their
genetic code. Life, then, is a constant winnowing and sifting of genetic
material.'' (Kingsbury 2009)

\begin{frame}{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Before initiating a breeding project, clear breeding objectives are
  defined based on factors such as producer needs, consumer preferences
  and needs, and environmental impact.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Broadly, objectives could be,}
\protect\hypertarget{broadly-objectives-could-be}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Feed the growing population
\item
  Maximize resource and energy use efficiency
\item
  Fasten return on investment
\item
  Introgress desired modification in crop species
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Specifically, in crop improvement,}
\protect\hypertarget{specifically-in-crop-improvement}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Increasing the potential productivity of a plant by modifying its
  morphological characteristics such as:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The number of kernels per ear in a cereal
  \item
    The weight of individual seeds within the pod of a pulse,
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Modifying physiological traits such as:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    harvest index,
  \item
    utilization of nutrients,
  \item
    tolerance to stress.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Quality and nutritive value are now of increasing importance,
  particularly in association with improved efficiency of production.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-16}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Modern agriculture is highly mechanized and for this reason some
  breeding programmes include objectives to make the crop more amenable
  to mechanical handling.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Development of monogerm beets for mechanical sowing thus eliminating
    the need for thinning, or the introduction of `jointless' tomatoes
    for mechanical harvesting.
  \item
    Use of some agrochemicals is often coupled with the need for
    specific crop characteristics e.g.~herbicide resistance.

\begin{frame}{Inter-disciplinary linkage of plant breeding (Poehlman
1987)}
\protect\hypertarget{inter-disciplinary-linkage-of-plant-breeding-poehlman1987breeding}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Botany: Plant breeders should be accomplished botanists in order to
  understand the taxonomy, anatomy, morphology, and reproduction of the
  plants with which they work.
\item
  Genetics and Cytogenetics: The plant breeder needs a thorough
  understanding of the mechanism of heredity in plants since modern
  plant-breeding methods are based on a knowledge of genetic principles
  and chromosome behavior. This knowledge is being extended to the
  molecular level with advances in biochemical genetics.
\item
  Plant Physiology: Variety adaptation is determined by the response of
  plants to their environment, which includes the effects of heat, cold,
  drought, and soil nutrient response. The plant breeder strives to make
  inherent modifications of physiological processes that will enable the
  plant to function more efficiently.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-17}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Plant Pathology: Plant disease reduces crop yields. Host resistance is
  an important means of combating many plant diseases. Evaluation of the
  response ofthe plant genotype to infection by the pathogen is an
  essential part of breeding for host plant resistance.
\item
  Entomology: Biological control of insect populations by breeding for
  insect resistance is an important way of reducing insect damage in
  crop plants.
\item
  Plant Biochemistry: Inherent improvements in the nutritive value of a
  crop variety are given attention by the plant breeder. Suitability for
  industrial utilization often determines the market demand for a
  particular variety of a crop. This includes such characteristics as
  the milling and baking qualities of a wheat variety, the cooking and
  eating qualities of a rice variety, or the fiber qualities of a cotton
  variety. Biochemical genetics is contributing toward a better
  understanding of the structure and function of the gene.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-18}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Statistics: The plant breeder compares the performance of many
  genetically different strains. Sound field plot techniques and
  suitable methods for statistical analyses of data are necessary to
  obtain reliable results and to interpret the results correctly. The
  application of statistical procedures has provided for a better
  understanding of the inheritance of quantitative characteristics and
  for predicting the possible genetic advance that may be obtained with
  particular systems of mating.
\item
  Agronomy: In addition to all of these, the breeder of field crops
  should be a sound agronomist. Plant breeders should know crops and
  their production. They should understand what the farmer wants and
  needs in the way of new varieties. Only then will they be able to
  evaluate critically the breeding materials available to them, plan an
  efficient breeding program, and direct their breeding efforts toward
  the agronomically important objectives.

\begin{itemize}
\item

\item
  Germplasm
\item
  Creation of variation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Genetic variation can be created by domestication, germplasm
    collection, plant introduction, hybridization, polyploidy,
    somaclonal variation and genetic engineering
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Selection

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Identification and isolation of plants having desirable combinations
    of characters and growing their progeny is called selection.
    Selection is necessarily based on phenotype. Various breeding
    methods have been designed to increase efficacy of selection.
    Selection finally yields an improved lines or population.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-19}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Newly selected lines/population are tested for yield and other
    traits. Performance is compared with existing best varieties
    (checks). Evaluation is a step-wise process, ordinary conducted at
    several locations for three or more years.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Multiplication

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This step concerns the large scale production of source/certified
    seed after release and notification of varieties. Seed production is
    usually done by seed production organizations, in concert with seed
    certification agencies.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Certification and cultivar release

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Certified seed is ultimately sold to the farmers who use it for
    commercial crop production. This activity alone makes it possible to
    reap the economic benefits from above activities.

\section{Achievements}\label{achievements}}

\begin{frame}{Achievements}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Yield increase

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Has been achieved through either directly targeting the yield
    \emph{per se} or its components. Theoretically, any characterstic
    that enables plant to perform better in given biotic/abiotic stress
    condition can increase yield.
  \item
    In US, yield of corn rose from about 2000 kg/ha in the 1940s to
    about 7000 kg/ha in the 1990s.
  \item
    In England, it took only 40 years for wheat yields to rise from 2
    metric tons/ ha to 6 metric tons/ha.
  \item
    Between 1961 and 2000, FAO shows:
  \item
    Wheat yield increased by 681\% in China, 301\% in India, 299\% in
    Europe, 235\% in Africa, 209\% in South America, and 175\% in the
    USA.
  \item
    Although, a half proportion of the entire gain in yield levels could
    be attributed to genetic improvement per se, others being due to
    agronomic practices.

  Enhanced value of food crops due to nutritional quality or
  compositional trait improvement or special purpose crops.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The shelf life of fruits (e.g., tomato) has been extended through
    the use of genetic engineering techniques to reduce the expression
    of compounds associated with fruit deterioration.
  \item
    For example, cereals tend to be low in lysine and threonine, while
    legumes tend to be low in cysteine and methionine (both sulfur
    containing amino acids). Now biofortified series of cereal crops
    that have enhanced amino acids contents are available (QPM maize).
