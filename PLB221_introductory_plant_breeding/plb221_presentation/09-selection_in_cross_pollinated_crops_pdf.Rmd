## Background

- Breeding cross-pollinated species tends to focus on population improvement rather than the improvement of individual plants, as is the focus in breeding self-pollinated species. 
- In addition to methods such as mass selection that are applicable to both self-pollinated and cross-pollinated species, there are specific methods that are suited to population improvement. 
- Certain methods are more effective and readily applied for breeding certain species than others.
