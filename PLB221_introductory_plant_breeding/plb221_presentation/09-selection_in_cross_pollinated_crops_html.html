# Selection in cross pollinated crops

# Introduction

- Plant species where normal mode of seed set is through a high degree of cross-pollination have characteristic reproductive features and population structure. 
- Each plant receives a blend of pollen from a large number of individuals each having different genotypes. 
- Such populations are characterized by a high degree of heterozygosity with tremendous free and potential genetic variation, which is maintained in a steady state by free gene flow among individuals within the populations. 
- In the development of hybrid varieties, the aim is to identify the most productive heterozygote from the population, which then is produced with the exclusion of other members of the population.

---

# Breeding methods

- The classification of population improvement is several, according to the unit of selection â€“ either individual plants or family of plants. 
- The method can also be grouped according to the populations undergoing selection as either intra-population or inter-population. 
  - In intra-population improvement, the end product will be a population or synthetic cultivar, and it may end up elite pure lines for hybrid production. Or, it can also be used for developing mixed genotype cultivars (in self-pollinated crops). Commonly used methods are mass selection, ear-to-row selection and recurrent selection. This consists of both single plant (mass selection) and family based selection (recurrent selection).
  - Inter-population improvement deals with the selection on the basis of the performance of a cross between two populations. The final product will be a hybrid cultivar with heterosis.

## Mass selection

- It is the simplest, easiest and oldest method of selection where individual plants are selected based on phenotypic performance, and seeds are bulked.
- It is effective in maize improvement at the initial stages but its efficacy is poor for improvement of yield.
- The selection after pollination does not provide any control over the pollen parent as result of which effective selection is limited only to female parents. 
- The heritability estimates are reduced by half, since only female parents are used to harvest seed whereas the pollen source is not known after the cross pollination has taken place.
- Also, since this selection is solely based on phenotype, heritability of the trait plays a pivotal role in its effectiveness -- mostly effective for additive genes.

&lt;!-- ## Expected genetic advance --&gt;

&lt;!-- \[ --&gt;
&lt;!-- \Delta G = \left[ \frac{\frac{1}{2}i \sigma^2_A}{\sigma^2_p} \right] = \left[ \frac{\frac{1}{2}i \sigma^2_A}{\sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_D + \sigma^2_{AE} + \sigma^2_{DE} + \sigma^2_e + \sigma^2_{me}} \right] --&gt;
&lt;!-- \] --&gt;

&lt;!-- `\(\sigma_p\)` = Phenotypic standard deviation in the population --&gt;
&lt;!-- `\(\sigma^2_A\)` = Additive variance --&gt;
&lt;!-- `\(\sigma^2_D\)` = Dominance variance --&gt;

&lt;!-- Other factors are interaction variances. `\(\Delta G_m\)` doubles with both sexes. This large denominator makes mass selection inefficient for low heritability traits. --&gt;

---

## Recurrent selection

- This type of selection is a refined version of the mass selection procedure and differs as follows:
  
  - Visually selected individuals out of the base population undergo progeny testing
  - Individuals selected on basis of the progeny test data are crossed with each other in every possible way to produce seed to form the new base population.

- In the simplest form, recurrent selection consists of selecting desired individuals within a population prior to mating followed by the intermating of selected individuals. Consequently, both female and male gametes have undergone selection, and genetic progress should be at least 100% faster than for mass selection.

---

- The recurrent selection has 3 major steps:
  - the parents are crossed in all possible combinations and individual families are created for evaluation, 
  - the families are evaluated and a new set of parents are selected, and 
  - the selected parents are inter-mated to produce the population for the next cycle of selection.
- The aforesaid cycle is repeated several times (3-5 times). The original cycle is labelled `\(C_0\)` and is called the base population. The subsequent cycles are named as `\(C_1, C_2, C_3, ... C_n\)`

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Simple recurrent selection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

- This method of selection is useful to improve one or more traits so that a new population that is superior to the original population is achieved.
- The source material may be random mating populations, synthetic cultivars and single-cross or double-cross plants.
- The improved population may be released as a new cultivar or used as a breding material (parent) in other breeding programmes.
- This selection ensures improvement of population without reduction in genetic variability.
- It is advisable to include as many parent as possible in the initaial crossing to increase genetic diversity.
- The breeder can decide on the number of generations of inter-mating that is appropriate for a breeding programme.

## Types of recurrent selection

- Simple recurrent selection: Similar to mass selection with 1-2 year per cycle. Does not involve a tester. Phenotypic scores are the basis for selection (aka., Phenotypic recurrent selection).
- Recurrent selection for general combining ability (Half sib progeny test procedure): When additive gene effects are more important.
- Recurrent selection for specific combining ability: When overdominance gene effects are more important.
- Reciprocal recurrent selection: When both gene effects are important. Two heterozygous population are involved, each serving as a tester for the other.

&lt;!-- ## Expected genetic advance --&gt;

&lt;!-- `$$\Delta G = \frac{CiV_A}{y \sigma_p}$$` --&gt;

&lt;!-- `\(\Delta G\)` = Expected genetic advance --&gt;
&lt;!-- `\(C\)` = Measure of parental control (C = 0.5 if selection is based on one parent and equals 1 when both parents are involved) --&gt;
&lt;!-- `\(i\)` = Selection intensity --&gt;
&lt;!-- `\(V_A\)` = Additive genetic variance among the units of selection --&gt;
&lt;!-- `\(y\)` = Number of years per cycle --&gt;
&lt;!-- `\(\sigma_p\)` = Phenotypic standard deviation among the units of selection --&gt;

## Half-sib selection with progeny testing

- Selections are made based on progeny test performance instead of phenotypic appearance of the parental plants. 
- Seed from selected half-sibs, which have been pollinated by random pollen from the population (meaning that only the female parent is known and selected, hence the term "half-sib") is grown in unreplicated progeny rows for the purpose of selection. 
- A part of the seed is planted to determine the yielding ability, or breeding value, for any character of each plant. 
- The seed from the most productive rows or remnant seed from the outstanding half-sibs is bulked to complete one cycle of selection.

&lt;/div&gt;


---

## Full-sib selection with progeny testing

- A number of full-sib families, each produced by making crosses between the two plants from the base population are evaluated in replicated trials. 
- A part of each full-sib family is saved for recombination. Based on evaluation the remnant seed of selected full-sib families is used to recombine the best families.
