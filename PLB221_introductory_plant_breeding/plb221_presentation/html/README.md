# Building xaringan presentation

Presentations hosted in this repo are inspired from University of Sydney theme for xaringan (remark.js). In fact, much of the content is outright copied. An elaborate example and guide are packed here: http://garthtarr.github.io/sydney_xaringan

To get started you will likely need:

```
install.packages("RefManageR")
install.packages("DT")
install.packages("tidyverse")
devtools::install_github('yihui/xaringan')
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/icon")
```
