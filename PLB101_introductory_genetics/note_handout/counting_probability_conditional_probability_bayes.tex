\question \label{quest:perm-1}

If you have 15 shirts and 8 pair of pants, how many outfits can you make ?

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:perm-1})

Since an outfit must consist of a shirt AND a pant, we can get: \(15 \times 8 = 120\) outfits.

\question \label{quest:perm-2}

How many three digit numbers have only even digits ?

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:perm-2})

Let us represent three digit numbers with: \(\under{x}\under{y}\under{z}\).

Then for \(x\), we can have \(\{2,4,6,8\}\) to choose from \(\Longrightarrow\) 4 digits,

For both \(y\) and \(z\), we have \(\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}\) to choose from \(\Longrightarrow\) 5 digits.

\(\therefore\) Total numbers that could be made (by arrangements of available digits): \(4 \times 5 \times 5 = 100\).

\question \label{quest:sample-space-1}

Three different people are to be selected at random, and each will be given one gift card. There is one card from Home Depot, one from Best Buy, and one from Red Lobster. The first person selected gets to choose one of the cards. The second person selected gets to choose between the two remaining cards. The thirds person selected gets the third card.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If each card is equally likely to be selected, determine the number of sample points in the sample space.
\item
  Determine the probability that the Best Buy card is selected first.
\item
  The cards are selected in the order: Best Buy, Red Lobster, Home Depot.
\end{enumerate}

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:sample-space-1})

Let the abbreviations Ho, Be and Re represent gift cards respectively from Home Depot, one from Best Buy, and one from Red Lobster. Gift cards could be selected by 3 persons consecutively in: \(3\times 2\times 1\) way. Thus, following possible outcomes are possibles

\(\{Ho,Be,Re\}\), \(\{Ho,Be,Re\}\),
\(\{Re,Be,Ho\}\), \(\{Re,Ho,Be\}\),
\(\{Be,Ho,Re\}\), \(\{Be,Re,Ho\}\).

Total of 6 sample points are possible.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Out of 6 total outcomes from sample space, 2 of them have \(Be\) selected at first. Hence the probability is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).
\item
  Exactly 1 of the outcomes of the sample space has the cards selected in the order \(\{Be, Re, Ho\}\). Hence the probability is \(\frac{1}{6}\).

\question \label{quest:odds-1}

One card is selected from a standard deck of cards. Determine

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the odds in favor of selecting a queen
\item
  the odds against selecting a queen
\end{enumerate}

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:odds-1})

There are 52 cards in a standard deck of cards, 4 of which are queens. Therefore, the probability of selecting a queen is \(\frac{4}{52}\), or \(\frac{1}{13}\). The probability the card selected is not a queen is \(1-\frac{1}{13} = \frac{12}{13}\).

Odds in favor of selecting a queen = \(\frac{P(\text{Selecting a queen})}{P(\text{Not selecting a queen})} = \frac{1/13}{12/13} = \frac{1}{12}\) \(\implies\) \(1:12\).

The odds against selecting a queen are \(12:1\).

\esolution

\question \label{quest:iids-1}

(Independent events) Suppose you draw two cards randomly from a deck. Let \(A\) denote the event that the first card is a \(\diamondsuit\), and B that the second card is a \(\diamondsuit\). Are events A and B independent ?

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:iids-1})

Clearly, \(P(A) = \frac{13}{52} = \frac{1}{4}\). Also, \(P(B)= \frac{1}{4}\). Now we compute \(P(A\cap B)\). This is the event that both cards are diamonds, and its probability is:

\[
P(A \cap B) = \frac{{13\choose 2}}{{52 \choose2}} = \frac{13\times 12}{52\times 51} = \frac{12}{4\times 51} = \frac{1}{17}.
\]

Here, \(n \choose k\) symbol \(\implies\) ``Choose \(k\) items to compose unordered collection of items from \(n\) items''.

On the other hand,

\[
P(A).P(B) = \frac{1}{4}.\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Therefore, \(P(A). P(B) \neq P(A\cap B)\), and the events are not independent.

\question \label{quest:prob-1}

If 5 coins are tossed together, determine the probability of getting

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  3H and 2T
\item
  At least 3H
\item
  More than 3H
\item
  Less than 3H
\item
  Not more than 3H
\end{enumerate}

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:prob-1})

Let \(a\) represent probability of turning head (\(P(H) = \frac{1}{2}\)) and \(b\) represent the probability of turning tail (\(P(T) = \frac{1}{2}\)), then, Binomial expansion can be used to mimic all 5 tosses.

\[
(a + b)^5 = a^5 + 5a^4b + 10 a^3 b^2 + 10 a^2 b^3 + 5 ab^4 + b^5
\]

Now,

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Probability(P) of 3H and 2T is given by \(\mathrm{3^{rd}}\) term, which is: \(10 a^3 b^2\) equals \(\frac{5}{16}\).
\item
  Probabilities of having (3H or 4H or 5H)
\item
  Probabilities of having (4H or 5H)
\item
  Probabilities of having (1H or 2H)
\item
  Probabilities of having (1H or 2H or 3H)

\question \label{quest:prob-6}

Suppose that a barrel contains many small plastic eggs. Some eggs are painted red and some are painted blue. 40\% of the eggs in the bin contain pearls, and 60\% contain nothing. 30\% of eggs containing pearls are painted blue, and 10\% of eggs containing nothing are painted blue. What is the probability that a blue egg contains a pearl?

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:prob-6})

We have,

\(\probP(\text{pearl}) = 40\%\)

\(\probP(\text{blue}|\text{pearl}) = 30\%\)

\(\probP(\text{blue}|\sim{}\text{pearl}) = 10\%\)

\(\probP(\text{pearl}|\text{blue}) = ?\)

It can be learnt that,

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Since 40\% of the eggs contain pearls and 30\% of the eggs containing pearls are painted blue, 12\% of the eggs altogether contain pearls and are painted blue.
\item
  Since 60\% of the eggs contain nothing and 10\% of the eggs containing nothing are painted blue, 6\% of the eggs contain nothing and are painted blue.
\item
  A total of 18\% (12 + 6) of the eggs are painted blue.
\end{itemize}

\(\therefore\) \(\probP(\text{pearl}|\text{blue}) = \frac{\probP(\text{perl}) \land \probP(\text{blue})}{\probP (\text{blue})} = \frac{12}{18}\)

\esolution

\question \label{quest:prob-7}

Suppose we draw a card and it turns out to be red. What are the odds that the card is a \(\diamondsuit\) ?

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:prob-7})

Let \(A\) denote getting a diamond and B getting a red card. Then \(\probP(A\cap B)\) is the probability that a card is red and a diamond, which simply means that it is a diamond, \(\probP(A\cap B) = 1/4\). The probability of a card being red is \(\probP(B) = 1/2\). Therefore, the probability of a card being a diamond, given that it is red, is:

\[
\probP (A|B) = \frac{\probP(A\cap B)}{\probP(B)} = \frac{1/4}{1/2} = 1/2.
\]

\esolution

\question \label{quest:prob-8}

Rolling three dice, what is the probability of getting a \(\epsdice{3}\) on the first roll if the sum of the three outputs is 6 ?

\bsolution (Question \ref{quest:prob-8})

Let \(A\) denote the even that the sum of the three outputs is 6, and \(B\) the event of getting a 3 on the first roll. We need to find \(P(B|A)\). By definition,

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}
\]

The outcomes in A are \(\{\epsdice{2},\epsdice{2},\epsdice{2}\}\), \(\{\epsdice{1},\epsdice{1},\epsdice{4}\}\), \(\{\epsdice{4},\epsdice{1},\epsdice{1}\}\), \(\{\epsdice{1},\epsdice{4},\epsdice{1}\}\), and the six permutations of \(\{1,2,3\}\), totalling ten outcomes. (\(\because~ _3P_3 = 3! = 6\).) Then we have \(P(A) = \frac{10}{6^3} = \frac{5}{108}\). The outcomes of \((A \cap B)\) are \(\{3,2,1\}\) and \(\{3,1,2\}\), so \(P(A\cap B) = \frac{2}{6^3} = \frac{1}{108}\). Then

\[
\large
P(B|A) = \frac{\frac{1}{108}}{\frac{5}{108}} = \frac{1}{5}.
\]

We could have used Bayes' law to compute the same probability:

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B).P(B)}{P(A)}.
\]

Then we need to know \(P(B)\) and \(P(A|B)\). The first is easy: the probability of getting a 3 in one roll of a die is \(P(B) = \frac{1}{6}\). The second is the probability of getting the sum of the three outputs equal to 6, given that the first output is \(\epsdice{3}\). This is the same as the probability of getting the sum of two outputs in two rolls equal to 3. There are two possibilities: \(\{1,2\}\) and \(\{2,1\}\). Therefore, \(P(A|B) = \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18}\). Bayes' law gives

\[
P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B).P(B)}{P(A)} = \frac{\frac{1}{18}.\frac{1}{6}}{\frac{5}{108}} = \frac{1}{5}.
