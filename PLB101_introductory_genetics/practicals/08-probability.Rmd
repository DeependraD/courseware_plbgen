# Probability

## Problem 1

If 5 coins are tossed together, determine the probability of getting

1. 3H and 2T
2. At least 3H
3. More than 3H
4. Less than 3H
5. Not more than 3H

## Solution 1

Let $a$ represent probability of turning head ($P(H) = \frac{1}{2}$) and $b$ represent the probability of turning tail ($P(T) = \frac{1}{2}$), then, Binomial expansion can be used to mimic all 5 tosses.

$$
(a + b)^5 = a^5 + 5a^4b + 10 a^3 b^2 + 10 a^2 b^3 + 5 ab^4 + b^5
$$

Now,

1. Probability(P) of 3H and 2T is given by $\mathrm{3^{rd}}$ term, which is: $10 a^3 b^2$ equals $\frac{5}{16}$.
2. Probabilities of having (3H or 4H or 5H)
3. Probabilities of having (4H or 5H)
4. Probabilities of having (1H or 2H)
5. Probabilities of having (1H or 2H or 3H)

## Problem 2

Two heterozygous brown-eyed (Bb) individuals have five children. What is the probability that two of the couple's five children will have blue eye ?

## Solution 2

Applying binomial expansion

1. Calculate individual probabilities (Using punnet square)

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{(\text{blue eyes})} &= p = \frac{1}{4} \\
P_{(\text{brown eyes})} &= q = \frac{3}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

2. Determine the number of events

$$
\begin{aligned}
n &= \text{total number of children} = 5 \\
x &= \text{total number of blue-eyed children} = 2
\end{aligned}
$$

3. Substituting the values in the following binomial equation, $2^{nd}$ term ($\frac{n!}{s! t!} p^2 q^3$) and its coefficient gives the probability of having two children with blue eyes. That is,

$$
P = \frac{5!}{2! \times 3!} \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 = 0.26
$$

This yields that 26% of the time, a heterozygote couples' five of the children will contain two with blue eyes and three with brown eyes.

## Problem 3

How often in  families of 5 children where one parent is heterozygous for malaria resistance and other is homozygous for malaria resistance will the children be 3 resistant girls and 2 resistant boys ?

## Problem 4

Albinism in human is controlled by a recessive gene c. From a marriage between two partners, if both partners are carriers, Cc for albinism, what is the chance that:

i. All 4 children of them are normal
ii. 3 normal and 1 albino
iii. 1 normal and 3 albino
iv. All 4 are albinos

## Problem 5

How often in families of 3 children where both parents are heterozygous for non-red hair ($Rr$) and have wavy hair ($h_1h_2$) will children be

i. a red haired girl, a non-red curly haired boy and a red straight haired girl ?
ii. two red wavy haired boy and one non-red straight haired girl ?

## Solution

Given,

- Total number of children ($n$): 3
- Non-red hair genotype: $Rr$
- Straight hair genotype: $h_1h_1$
- Wavy hair genotype: $h_1h_2$
- Curly hair genotype: $h_2h_2$
- Dominance relation follows: non-Red ($R$) > Red ($r$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
&\female &\times &\male\\
&Rr,h_1h_2 & & Rrh_1h_2
\end{aligned}
$$

Segregation follows,

- At "R" loci: $\frac{1}{4}RR: \frac{2}{4}Rr: \frac{1}{4}rr$ (3 Non-red, 1 Red)
- At "h" loci: $\frac{1}{4}h_1h_1: \frac{2}{4}h_1h_2: \frac{1}{4}h_2h_2$ (1 Straight, 2 Wavy, 1 Curly)

We have,

- P(1 red wavy haired girl) = $\frac{1}{4}\times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}$
- P(1 red straight haired girl) = $\frac{1}{4}\times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{32}$
- P(1 non-red wavy haired girl) = $\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$
- P(1 non-red straight haired girl) = $\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}$
- P(1 red wavy haired boy) = $\frac{1}{4}\times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}$
- P(1 non-red straight haired boy) = $\frac{3}{4}\times \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{32}$

Probability of occurrence of particular combination from multiple **independent events** (for example, trinomial combination of certain genotype at "R" loci, at "h" loci and certain sex type) could be obtained by multinomial distribution.

$\longrightarrow$ (i)

Combined probability of a red haired girl, a non-red curly haired boy and a red straight haired girl ($P(A)$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
&= \frac{n!}{s!t!u!} \times p^s.q^t.r^u \\
&= \frac{3!}{1!1!1!} \times \left(\frac{1}{16}\right)^1.\left(\frac{3}{32}\right)^1.\left(\frac{1}{32}\right)^1 \\
&= \frac{18}{16\times 32 \times 32} \\
&= \frac{18}{163884}
\end{aligned}
$$


$\longrightarrow$ (ii)

Combined probability of two red wavy haired boy and one non-red straight haired girl ($P(B)$)

$$
\begin{aligned}
&= \frac{n!}{s!t!} \times p^s.q^t \\
&= \frac{3!}{2!1!} \times \left(\frac{1}{16}\right)^2.\left(\frac{3}{32}\right)^1 \\
&= \frac{9}{16^2\times 32} \\
&= \frac{9}{8192}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Problem 6

A woman with blood group A, whose father was of blood group B marries a man of blood group B whose mother was of blood group A.

1. What are the expected proportions of the blood group of children arising from such a marriage ?
2. What is the probability that, out of four uncle on their maternal side, children have 2 uncles with "AB" blood group and 1 with "O" blood group and 1 with blood group "A" ?


```{r blood-group-diagram, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./scripts/blood-group_pedigree_diagram_mod.pdf")
```

Here, we determine the two parents involved in the marriage and procreation as $I^B I^0$ female and $I^A I^0$ male.

Thus the progenies of this crossing may have all of $I^A I^B, I^A I^0, I^B I^0$ and $I^0 I^0$ the blood group types in equal proportion.


For the second question,

We note that all maternal uncles of the children (generation: $G_n$) are born to the parents ($G_{n-2}$) of the childrens' mother ($G_{n-1}$). Thus we have following possible cases for formation of progenies in $G_{n-1}$ generation.

Case-I,

$$
I^A I^A \times I^B I^0 \longrightarrow I^A I^B, I^B I^0
$$
Case-II,

$$
I^A I^0 \times I^B I^0 \longrightarrow I^A I^B, I^A I^0, I^B I^0, I^0 I^0
$$

Case-III,

$$
I^A I^B \times I^B I^0 \longrightarrow I^A I^B, I^A I^0, I^B I^B, I^B I^0
$$

Hence of a total of 10 individuals progenies possible in equal proportions from the above cases of crossings, we see that,

- probability ($I^A I^0$ or $I^A I^A$) = $\frac{3}{10} + 0 = \frac{3}{10}$ 
- probability ($I^A I^B$) = $\frac{3}{10}$
- probability ($I^B I^B$ or $I^B I^0$) = $\frac{2}{10} + \frac{1}{10} = \frac{3}{10}$ 
- probability ($I^0 I^0$) = $\frac{1}{10}$

For the maternal $G_{n-1}$ generation to have 2 people (irrespective of sex) with "AB" blood group, 1 people (irrespective of sex) with "0" blood group and 1 people (irrespective of sex) with "A" blood group, we could expand a polynomial of order 3 having 4 terms and calculate the term containing favorable outcomes. i.e.,

$$
\frac{n!}{2!\cdot 1! \cdot 1!\cdot 0!} \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^1 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^1 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^0
$$
